        <p>Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night, and has long been associated with control of the sleep–wake cycle.</p>
<p>In vertebrates, melatonin is involved in synchronizing circadian rhythms, including sleep–wake timing and blood pressure regulation, and in control of seasonal rhythmicity including reproduction, fattening, moulting and hibernation. Many of its effects are through activation of the melatonin receptors, while others are due to its role as an antioxidant. In plants, it functions to defend against oxidative stress. It is also present in various foods.</p>
<img src="/2022/04/25/2022-04-25-14-45-melatonin/melatonin.svg" width="222" align="left">

<p>In animals, melatonin plays an important role in the regulation of sleep–wake cycles. Human infants’ melatonin levels become regular in about the third month after birth, with the highest levels measured between midnight and 8:00 am. Human melatonin production decreases as a person ages. Also, as children become teenagers, the nightly schedule of melatonin release is delayed, leading to later sleeping and waking times.</p>
<img src="/2022/04/25/2022-04-25-14-45-melatonin/ball.png" width="222" align="right">

<p>Melatonin occurs at high concentrations within mitochondrial fluid which greatly exceed the plasma concentration of melatonin. Due to its capacity for free radical scavenging, indirect effects on the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and its significant concentrations within mitochondria, a number of authors have indicated that melatonin has an important physiological function as a mitochondrial antioxidant.</p>
<img src="/2022/04/25/2022-04-25-14-45-melatonin/rhythm.svg" width="222" align="left">

<p>While it is known that melatonin interacts with the immune system, the details of those interactions are unclear. An antiinflammatory effect seems to be the most relevant. There have been few trials designed to judge the effectiveness of melatonin in disease treatment. Most existing data are based on small, incomplete trials. Any positive immunological effect is thought to be the result of melatonin acting on high-affinity receptors (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120195">MT1 and MT2</a>) expressed in immunocompetent cells. In preclinical studies, melatonin may enhance cytokine production, and by doing this, counteract acquired immunodeficiences. Some studies also suggest that melatonin might be useful fighting infectious disease including viral, such as HIV, and bacterial infections, and potentially in the treatment of cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Civil aviation</strong> is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-military and non-state aviation, both private and commercial. Most of the countries in the world are members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and work together to establish common standards and recommended practices for civil aviation through that agency.</p>
<p>Civil aviation includes three major categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial air transport, including scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights</li>
<li>Aerial work, in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, photography, surveying, search and rescue, etc.</li>
<li>General aviation (GA), including all other civil flights, private or commercial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commercial aviation</strong> is the part of civil aviation that involves operating aircraft for remuneration or hire, as opposed to private aviation.</p>
<p><strong>Flight or Airline</strong> is a scheduled trip by plane between designated airports.</p>
<h3 id="Civil-aviation-authorities"><a href="#Civil-aviation-authorities" class="headerlink" title="Civil aviation authorities"></a>Civil aviation authorities</h3><p>The Convention on International Civil Aviation (the “Chicago Convention”) was originally established in 1944; it states that signatories should collectively work to harmonize and standardize the use of airspace for safety, efficiency and regularity of air transport. Each signatory country, of which there are at least 193, has a civil aviation authority (such as the FAA in the United States) to oversee the following areas of civil aviation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personnel licensing — regulating the basic training and issuance of licenses and certificates.</li>
<li>Flight operations — carrying out safety oversight of commercial operators.</li>
<li>Airworthiness — issuing certificates of registration and certificates of airworthiness to civil aircraft, and overseeing the safety of aircraft maintenance organizations.</li>
<li>Aerodromes — designing and constructing aerodrome facilities.</li>
<li>Air traffic services — managing the traffic inside of a country’s airspace.</li>

<p><strong>民用航空</strong>（简称 <strong>民航</strong> ）是指除军事、公务（例如警务、海关）用途以外的航空服务，包括私人或商业性质的飞行。世界上大多数国家都是国际民航组织（ICAO）成员，并透过该组织制定民用航空的共同标准。</p>
<p>民用航空包括两大类：</p>
<ul>
<li>定期航空运输，包括在定期航线上运营的所有客运和货运航班。</li>

Rocket equation is a mathematical equation that describes the motion of vehicles that follow the basic principle of a rocket: a device that can apply acceleration to itself using thrust by expelling part of its mass with high velocity can thereby move due to the conservation of momentum.
Ideal Rocket Equation$$\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{e}} \ln \frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}&#x3D;I_{\mathrm{sp}} g_{0} \ln \frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$
where:

$\Delta v$ is delta-v – the maximum change of velocity of the vehicle (with no external forces acting).
${m_{0}}$ is the initial total mass, including propellant, a.k.a. wet mass.
${m_{f}}$ is the final total mass without propellant, a.k.a. dry mass.
$v_{\mathrm{e}} &#x3D; I_{\mathrm{sp}} g_{0}$ is the effective exhaust velocity, where:

$I_{\mathrm{sp}}$ is the specific impulse in dimension of time.
$g_{0}$ is standard gravity.

$\ln$ is is the natural logarithm function.

Given the effective exhaust velocity $v_{\mathrm{e}}$ (determined by a rocket motor’s design), a desired delta-v (for example, escape velocity), and a given dry mass ${m_{f}}$, the equation can be used to find the required wet mass ${m_{0}} - {m_{f}}$ :
$$m_{0}&#x3D;m_{f} e^{\frac{\Delta v}{v_{\mathrm{e}}}}$$


So the necessary wet mass grows exponentially with the desired delta-v, as illustrated in the chart.
Terms of the equationDelta-vDelta-v (literally “change in velocity”), symbolised as ${\Delta v}$ and pronounced delta-vee, as used in spacecraft flight dynamics, is a measure of the impulse that is needed to perform a maneuver such as launching from, or landing on a planet or moon, or an in-space orbital maneuver. It is a scalar that has the units of speed. As used in this context, it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle.
Delta-v is produced by reaction engines, such as rocket engines and is proportional to the thrust per unit mass, and burn time, and is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given manoeuvre through the rocket equation.
For multiple manoeuvres, delta-v sums linearly.
For interplanetary missions delta-v is often plotted on a porkchop plot which displays the required mission delta-v as a function of launch date.
Mass fractionIn aerospace engineering, the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle’s mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle’s performance. In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design. Another related measure is the payload fraction, which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload.
Effective exhaust velocityThe effective exhaust velocity is often specified as a specific impulse and they are related to each other by:
$$v_{\mathrm{e}}&#x3D;g_{0} I_{\mathrm{sp}}$$
where

$I_{\mathrm{sp}}$ is the specific impulse in seconds,
$v_{\mathrm{e}}$ is the specific impulse measured in $m&#x2F;s$, which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in $m&#x2F;s$ (or $ft&#x2F;s$ if g is in $ft&#x2F;s^{2}$),
$g_{0}$ is the standard gravity, 9.80665 $m&#x2F;s^{2}$ (in Imperial units 32.174 $ft&#x2F;s^{2}$).

Examples
Single-stage-to-orbit rocket: $1-e^{-9.7 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.884$, therefore 88.4% of the initial total mass has to be propellant. The remaining 11.6% is for the engines, the tank, and the payload.
Two-stage-to-orbit: suppose that the first stage should provide a ${\Delta v}$ of 5,000 meters per second (16,000 $ft&#x2F;s$); $1-e^{-5.0 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.671$, therefore 67.1% of the initial total mass has to be propellant to the first stage. The remaining mass is 32.9%. After disposing of the first stage, a mass remains equal to this 32.9%, minus the mass of the tank and engines of the first stage. Assume that this is 8% of the initial total mass, then 24.9% remains. The second stage should provide a ${\Delta v}$ of 4,700 meters per second (15,000 $ft&#x2F;s$); $1-e^{-4.7 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.648$, therefore 64.8% of the remaining mass has to be propellant, which is 16.2% of the original total mass, and 8.7% remains for the tank and engines of the second stage, the payload, and in the case of a space shuttle, also the orbiter. Thus together 16.7% of the original launch mass is available for all engines, the tanks, and payload.

StagesIn the case of sequentially thrusting rocket stages, the equation applies for each stage, where for each stage the initial mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket after discarding the previous stage, and the final mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket just before discarding the stage concerned. For each stage the specific impulse may be different.
For example, if 80% of the mass of a rocket is the fuel of the first stage, and 10% is the dry mass of the first stage, and 10% is the remaining rocket, then
$$\begin{aligned}\Delta v &amp;&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{e}} \ln \frac{100}{100-80} \&amp;&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{e}} \ln 5 \&amp;&#x3D;1.61 v_{\mathrm{e}}\end{aligned}$$
With three similar, subsequently smaller stages with the same $v_{\mathrm{e}}$ for each stage, we have
$$\Delta v&#x3D;3 v_{\mathrm{e}} \ln 5&#x3D;4.83 v_{\mathrm{e}}$$
and the payload is 10% × 10% × 10% &#x3D; 0.1% of the initial mass.
A comparable SSTO rocket, also with a 0.1% payload, could have a mass of 11.1% for fuel tanks and engines, and 88.8% for fuel. This would give
$$\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{e}} \ln (100 &#x2F; 11.2)&#x3D;2.19 v_{\mathrm{e}}$$
If the motor of a new stage is ignited before the previous stage has been discarded and the simultaneously working motors have a different specific impulse (as is often the case with solid rocket boosters and a liquid-fuel stage), the situation is more complicated.
DerivationsConsider the following system:


In the following derivation, “the rocket” is taken to mean “the rocket and all of its unexpended propellant”.
Newton’s second law of motion relates external forces ($F_{i}$) to the change in linear momentum of the whole system (including rocket and exhaust) as follows:
$$\sum F_{i}&#x3D;\lim {\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{P{2}-P_{1}}{\Delta t}$$
where $P_{1}$ is the momentum of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$ :
$$P_{1}&#x3D;(m+\Delta m) V$$
and $P_{2}$ is the momentum of the rocket and exhausted mass at time $t &#x3D; \Delta t$ :
$$P_{2}&#x3D;m(V+\Delta V)+\Delta m V_{\mathrm{e}}$$
and where, with respect to the observer:
$V$ is the velocity of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$
$V+\Delta V$ is the velocity of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; \Delta t$
$V_{\mathrm{e}}$ is the velocity of the mass added to the exhaust (and lost by the rocket) during time $\Delta t$
$m+\Delta m$ is the mass of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$
$m$  is the mass of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; \Delta t$
The velocity of the exhaust $V_{\mathrm{e}}$ in the observer frame is related to the velocity of the exhaust in the rocket frame $v_{\mathrm{e}}$ by (since exhaust velocity is in the negative direction)
$$V_{\mathrm{e}}&#x3D;V-v_{\mathrm{e}}$$
Solving yields:
$$P_{2}-P_{1}&#x3D;m \Delta V-v_{\mathrm{e}} \Delta m$$
and, using $dm &#x3D; - \Delta m$ , since ejecting a positive $\Delta m$ results in a decrease in mass in time,
$$\sum F_{i}&#x3D;m \frac{d V}{d t}+v_{\mathrm{e}} \frac{d m}{d t}$$
If there are no external forces then $\sum F_{i} &#x3D; 0$ (conservation of linear momentum) and
$$-m \frac{d V}{d t}&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{e}} \frac{d m}{d t}$$
Assuming $v_{\mathrm{e}}$ is constant, this may be integrated as follows:
$$-\int_{V}^{V+\Delta V} \mathrm{d} V&#x3D;v_{e} \int_{m_{0}}^{m_{f}} \frac{1}{m} \mathrm{d} m$$
This then yields
$$\Delta V&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{e}} \ln \frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$
or equivalently
$$m_{f}&#x3D;m_{0} e^{-\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\mathrm{e}}}$$
or
$$m_{0}&#x3D;m_{f} e^{\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\mathrm{e}}}$$
or 
$$m_{0}-m_{f}&#x3D;m_{f}\left(e^{\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\mathrm{e}}}-1\right)$$
where $m_{0}$ is the initial total mass including propellant, $m_{f}$ the final mass, and $v_{\mathrm{e}}$ the velocity of the rocket exhaust with respect to the rocket (the specific impulse, or, if measured in time, that multiplied by gravity-on-Earth acceleration).
The value $m_{0} - m_{f}$ is the total working mass of propellant expended.
$\Delta V$ is the integration over time of the magnitude of the acceleration produced by using the rocket engine (what would be the actual acceleration if external forces were absent). In free space, for the case of acceleration in the direction of the velocity, this is the increase of the speed. In the case of an acceleration in opposite direction (deceleration) it is the decrease of the speed. Of course gravity and drag also accelerate the vehicle, and they can add or subtract to the change in velocity experienced by the vehicle. Hence delta-v may not always be the actual change in speed or velocity of the vehicle.
Impulse-basedThe equation can also be derived from the basic integral of acceleration in the form of force (thrust) over mass. By representing the delta-v equation as the following:
$$\Delta v&#x3D;\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} \frac{|T|}{m_{0}-t \Delta m} d t$$
where $T$ is thrust, $m_{0}$ is the initial (wet) mass and $\Delta m$ is the initial mass minus the final (dry) mass,
and realising that the integral of a resultant force over time is total impulse, assuming thrust is the only force involved,
$$\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} F d t&#x3D;J$$
The integral is found to be:
$$J \frac{\ln \left(m_{0}\right)-\ln \left(m_{f}\right)}{\Delta m}$$
Realising that impulse over the change in mass is equivalent to force over propellant mass flow rate (p), which is itself equivalent to exhaust velocity,
$$\frac{J}{\Delta m}&#x3D;\frac{F}{p}&#x3D;V_{\mathrm{exh}}$$
the integral can be equated to
$$\Delta v&#x3D;V_{\mathrm{exh}} \ln \left(\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}\right)$$
Acceleration-basedImagine a rocket at rest in space with no forces exerted on it (Newton’s First Law of Motion). From the moment its engine is started (clock set to 0) the rocket expels gas mass at a constant mass flow rate $R$ ($kg&#x2F;s$) and at exhaust velocity relative to the rocket $v_{e}$ ($m&#x2F;s$). This creates a constant force $F$ propelling the rocket that is equal to $R \times v_{e}$. The rocket is subject to a constant force, but its total mass is decreasing steadily because it is expelling gas. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, its acceleration at any time $t$ is its propelling force $F$ divided by its current mass $m$:
$$a&#x3D;\frac{d v}{d t}&#x3D;-\frac{F}{m(t)}&#x3D;-\frac{R v_{\mathrm{e}}}{m(t)}$$
Now, the mass of fuel the rocket initially has on board is equal to $m_{0} – m_{f}$. For the constant mass flow rate $R$ it will therefore take a time $T &#x3D; (m_{0} – m_{f})&#x2F;R$ to burn all this fuel. Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to time from $0$ to $T$ (and noting that $R &#x3D; dm&#x2F;dt$ allows a substitution on the right), we obtain
$$\Delta v&#x3D;v_{f}-v_{0}&#x3D;-v_{\mathrm{e}}\left[\ln m_{f}-\ln m_{0}\right]&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{e}} \ln \left(\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}\right)$$
Limit of finite mass “pellet” expulsionThe rocket equation can also be derived as the limiting case of the speed change for a rocket that expels its fuel in the form of $N$ pellets consecutively, as $N \rightarrow \infty$, with an effective exhaust speed $v_{\mathrm{eff}}$ such that the mechanical energy gained per unit fuel mass is given by $\frac{1}{2} v_{\mathrm{eff}}^{2}$ .
In the rocket’s center-of-mass frame, if a pellet of mass $m_{p}$ is ejected at speed $u$ and the remaining mass of the rocket is $m$ , the amount of energy converted to increase the rocket’s and pellet’s kinetic energy is
$$\frac{1}{2} m_{p} v_{\mathrm{eff}}^{2}&#x3D;\frac{1}{2} m_{p} u^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m(\Delta v)^{2}$$
Using momentum conservation in the rocket’s frame just prior to ejection, $u&#x3D;\Delta v \frac{m}{m_{p}}$ , from which we find
$$\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{eff}} \frac{m p}{\sqrt{m\left(m+m_{p}\right)}}$$
Let $\phi$ be the initial fuel mass fraction on board and $m_{0}$ the initial fueled-up mass of the rocket. Divide the total mass of fuel $\phi m_{0}$ into $N$ discrete pellets each of mass $m_{p} &#x3D; \phi m_{0} &#x2F; N$ . The remaining mass of the rocket after ejecting $j$ pellets is then $m&#x3D;m_{0}(1-j\phi &#x2F;N)$. The overall speed change after ejecting $j$ pellets is the sum
$$\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{eff}} \sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \frac{\phi &#x2F; N}{\sqrt{(1-j \phi &#x2F; N)(1-j \phi &#x2F; N+\phi &#x2F; N)}}$$
Notice that for large $N$ the last term in the denominator $\phi &#x2F; N \ll 1$ and can be neglected to give
$$\Delta v \approx v_{\mathrm{eff}} \sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \frac{\phi &#x2F; N}{1-j \phi &#x2F; N}&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{eff}} \sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \frac{\Delta x}{1-x_{j}} \text { where } \Delta x&#x3D;\frac{\phi}{N} \text { and } x_{j}&#x3D;\frac{j \phi}{N}$$
As $N \rightarrow \infty$ this Riemann sum becomes the definite integral
$$\lim {N \rightarrow \infty} \Delta v&#x3D;v{\mathrm{eff}} \int_{0}^{\phi} \frac{d x}{1-x}&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{eff}} \ln \frac{1}{1-\phi}&#x3D;v_{\mathrm{eff}} \ln \frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$
since the final remaining mass of the rocket is $m_{f}&#x3D;m_{0}(1-\phi)$ .
Special relativityIf special relativity is taken into account, the following equation can be derived for a relativistic rocket, with $\Delta v$ again standing for the rocket’s final velocity (after expelling all its reaction mass and being reduced to a rest mass of $m_{1}$) in the inertial frame of reference where the rocket started at rest (with the rest mass including fuel being $m_{0}$) , and $c$ standing for the speed of light in a vacuum:
$$\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}&#x3D;\left[\frac{1+\frac{\Delta v}{c}}{1-\frac{\Delta v}{c}}\right]^{\frac{c}{2 v_{\mathrm{e}}}}$$
Writing $\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}$ as $R$ allows this equation to be rearranged as
$$\frac{\Delta v}{c}&#x3D;\frac{R^{\frac{2 v_{\mathrm{e}}}{c}}-1}{R^{\frac{2 v_{\mathrm{e}}}{c}}+1}$$
Then, using the identity
$$R^{\frac{2 v_{\mathrm{e}}}{c}}&#x3D;\exp \left[\frac{2 v_{\mathrm{e}}}{c} \ln R\right]$$
(here “$\exp$” denotes the exponential function; see also Natural logarithm as well as the “power” identity at Logarithmic identities)
and the identity $\tanh x&#x3D;\frac{e^{2 x}-1}{e^{2 x}+1}$ (see Hyperbolic function), this is equivalent to
$$\Delta v&#x3D;c \tanh \left(\frac{v_{\mathrm{e}}}{c} \ln \frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}\right)$$

        <p>Quaking or shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon undoubtedly known to humans from the earliest times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated based on the observed effects, as categorized on various seismic intensity scales. Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the Earth’s crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions but also on the strength or magnitude of the rupture, and on its distance.</p>
<p>Subsequent scales (see seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.</p>
<p>Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as “Richter magnitude” or “Richter scale”, standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake’s strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake.</p>
<h3 id="Measuring-and-locating-earthquakes"><a href="#Measuring-and-locating-earthquakes" class="headerlink" title="Measuring and locating earthquakes"></a>Measuring and locating earthquakes</h3><p>Seismic waves travel through the Earth’s interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface wave magnitude was developed as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.</p>
<p>Every tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longitudinal P-waves (shock- or pressure waves)</li>
<li>Transverse S-waves (both body waves)</li>
<li>Surface waves – (Rayleigh and Love waves)</li>
</ul>
<p>Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km&#x2F;s (1.9 mi&#x2F;s) up to 13 km&#x2F;s (8.1 mi&#x2F;s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth’s interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly.</p>
<p>In the upper crust, P-waves travel in the range 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) per second (or lower) in soils and unconsolidated sediments, increasing to 3–6 km (1.9–3.7 mi) per second in solid rock. In the lower crust, they travel at about 6–7 km (3.7–4.3 mi) per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to about 13 km (8.1 mi) per second. The velocity of S-waves ranges from 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) per second in light sediments and 4–5 km (2.5–3.1 mi) per second in the Earth’s crust up to 7 km (4.3 mi) per second in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth’s mantle.</p>
<p>On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S-wave times 8. Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure.</p>
<p>S-waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P-waves. P-waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S-waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions.</p>
<p>Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.</p>
<p><strong>地震</strong>是地球表层或表层下的振动所造成的地面震动，可由自然现象如地壳运动、火山活动及陨石撞击引起，亦可由人为活动如地下核试验造成，不过历史上主要的灾害性地震都由地壳的突然运动所造成。地震的影响力涵盖岩石圈及水圈 ── 当地震发生时，可能会连带引发地表断裂、大地震动、土壤液化、山崩、余震、海啸、甚至是火山活动，并影响人类的生存及活动。</p>
<p>地震产生的原因是因为地壳在板块运动的过程中累积应力，当地壳无法继续累积应力时，地壳会破裂，释放出地震波，使地面发生震动，地震可由地震仪透过对地震波的观察来量测，地震震级表示地震所释放出来的能量大小，地震烈度指地震在该地点造成的震动程度，地震的发生处称为震源，其投影至地表的位置为震中。</p>
<p>并非世界上所有的地区都会发生地震。地震与火山分布一样，主要集中在板块相互作用的地区。目前世界上主要分为三个频繁发生地震的“地震带”：环太平洋地震带（占80%）、从地中海一路向东延伸至喜马拉雅山区和印尼的欧亚地震带、位于各大洋洋中脊的洋中脊地震带。并不是所有地震都发生在以上三个地震带，另外有一小部分大地震发生在板块内部，主要集中在大的活动断层带及其附近地区。</p>
<h3 id="地震波"><a href="#地震波" class="headerlink" title="地震波"></a>地震波</h3><p>根据弹性回跳理论，造成地震的原因是岩石中断层的破裂。当断层破裂时，两侧的岩体会相对移动并释放出累积的能量。虽然其中大部分的能量都在克服摩擦力中损失为热能，但是剩下的部分则转换为动能，并以弹性波的形式散发出去，这些波称为地震波。地震波是地震的直接表现，因此，研究地震波的到来时间、大小、振动方式等，就可以了解一个地震的发生时间、大小、发生机制等，进而研究地震。</p>
<p>在地球物理学上，由于地震波具备物理上实体波的特性，因此，地震波在穿越不同介质时，便有机会发生折射、反射及全反射。当许多波叠加在一起时，还有机会发生共振，并产生驻波。换句话说，研究地震波，除了了解地震本身外，还可以一窥地球内部堂奥。因为地球很大，挖深井等直接方法研究内部构造效果有限，因此分析地震波是目前人类最常用的地球物理方法。</p>
<p>地震波主要分为三种：实体波、面波和尾波。</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Seismogram.gif" alt="波形图"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>地震仪纪录下的地震波，红线是先到来的P波，绿线是较晚的S波。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>地震波是地震震源瞬间散发能量初方式，当地球物质在实体波经过时，可能以三维方式（上下、左右、前后）震动。如果不同质点间的震动方向属于（相对于波速方向的）前后震动，代表震波以前后压缩、纵波的方式向外传递，这种一密一疏的震波称为“Ｐ波”。P代表主要（Primary）或压缩（Pressure）。由于Ｐ波的传播来自于在传播方向上施加压力，而地球内部几乎不可压缩，因此P波很容易通过介质传递能量。事实上，Ｐ波是所有地震波里最快的波，因此也会是地震仪第一个记录到的波。因为压缩力在固体、液体中都能存在，因此Ｐ波能在固体和液体中传播。</p>
<p>还有一种实体波到来的较晚，称为“S波”。S波中的S代表次要（Secondary）或剪力（Shear）。在S波的行进过程中，不同于P波，质点会在上下或左右方向震动、以横波的方式前进。因为液体无法忍受剪切，所以S波不能通过液体（例如外地核），Ｐ波则可。Ｓ波的波速约为Ｐ波的0.58倍，振幅约为P波的1.4倍。由于当地震波从地底来到地表时，S波的震动方向平行于地表的分量较多，较容易水平拉扯建筑物，而一般建筑垂直耐震能力较强，水平耐震能力较弱，故S波经常是造成地震破坏的主因。</p>
<p>由于接近地表的地层地震波速率较低。因此，再进地表处发生的地震，很容易把能量送进地表的低速层内，这些蓄积的能量波称为“陷波”。当累积的陷波彼此干涉，倘若发生建设性干涉，便有机会使地层共振，使能量沿地表传播。面波传递速度较S波慢一些。P波及S波干涉的面波为瑞利波（Rayleigh Wave），又称为地滚波，粒子运动方式类似海浪，在垂直面上，粒子呈逆时针椭圆形振动，震动振幅一样会随深度增加而减少。由S波相互干涉的面波为勒夫波（Love Wave），振动只发生在水平方向上，没有垂直分量，差别是侧向震动振幅会随深度增加而减少。</p>
<p>在近距离地震纪录（小于200千米）中，在S波后方的波包并非面波，而是尾波。地球内部虽然大致是均匀的，但小部分有不均匀的质点分布，越靠近地表越多（例如断层或岩石裂痕）。当震波向外传播时，这些不均匀或散射质点或与震波作用，产生散射现象。此散射波在纪录中会形成尾波。尾波的长短与震波耗散为热能的程度有关。例如月球因为刚性较低，耗散低，故尾波时间长。尾波如同地震图上异质性所留下的“指纹”，研究尾波，可以促进对一地地质结构之了解。</p>

        <p><strong>Deep Space Network</strong> (DSN) currently consists of three deep-space communications facilities placed approximately 120 degrees apart around the Earth. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (35°25′36″N 116°53′24″W) outside Barstow, California. For details of Goldstone’s contribution to the early days of space probe tracking.</li>
<li>the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (40°25′53″N 4°14′53″W), 60 kilometres (37 mi) west of Madrid, Spain.</li>
<li>the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) in the Australian Capital Territory (35°24′05″S 148°58′54″E), 40 kilometres (25 mi) southwest of Canberra, Australia near the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each facility is situated in semi-mountainous, bowl-shaped terrain to help shield against radio frequency interference. The strategic placement with nearly 120-degree separation permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates, which helps to make the DSN the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world.</p>
<p>All DSN antennas are steerable, high-gain, parabolic reflector antennas. The antennas and data delivery systems make it possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>acquire telemetry data from spacecraft.</li>
<li>transmit commands to spacecraft.</li>
<li>upload software modifications to spacecraft.</li>
<li>track spacecraft position and velocity.</li>
<li>perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations.</li>
<li>measure variations in radio waves for radio science experiments.</li>
<li>gather science data.</li>
<li>monitor and control the performance of the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DSN operates according to the standards of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultative_Committee_for_Space_Data_Systems">Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems</a>, as do most other deep space networks, and hence the DSN is able to interoperate with the networks of other space agencies.</p>
<h2 id="Deep-Space"><a href="#Deep-Space" class="headerlink" title="Deep Space"></a>Deep Space</h2><p>Tracking vehicles in deep space is quite different from tracking missions in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit">low Earth orbit (LEO)</a>. Deep space missions are visible for long periods of time from a large portion of the Earth’s surface, and so require few stations (the DSN has only three main sites). These few stations, however, require huge antennas, ultra-sensitive receivers, and powerful transmitters in order to transmit and receive over the vast distances involved.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/nav.svg" width="444">

<p>Deep space is defined in several different ways. According to a 1975 NASA report, the DSN was designed to communicate with “spacecraft traveling approximately 16,000 km (10,000 miles) from Earth to the farthest planets of the solar system.” JPL diagrams state that at an altitude of 30,000 km (19,000 mi), a spacecraft is always in the field of view of one of the tracking stations.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union">International Telecommunication Union</a>, which sets aside various frequency bands for deep space and near Earth use, defines “deep space” to start at a distance of 2 million km (1.2 million mi) from the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>This definition means that missions to the Moon, and the Earth–Sun <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point">Lagrangian points</a> L1 and L2, are considered near space and cannot use the ITU’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_space_bands">deep space bands</a>. Other Lagrangian points may or may not be subject to this rule due to distance.</p>

It is a spacecraft tracking station in Saku, Nagano, opened in October, 1984. The main feature of the station is a 64-meter beam waveguide antenna.</p>
<p>Usuda was the first deep-space antenna constructed with beam-waveguide technology. Although this construction dramatically simplifies installation and maintenance of electronics, it was previously thought to offer poor noise performance. However, after the U.S. Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) tested this antenna and found the noise performance was better than its conventional 64-meter antennas, it too switched to this method of construction for all subsequent antennas of their Deep Space Network (DSN).</p>
<p>Because the 64 meter antenna is aging, JAXA is building a new antenna nearby. This new antenna, called GREAT (Ground Station for Deep Space Exploration and Telecommunication) will be slightly smaller (54 meters in diameter) but have better surface accuracy and hence be capable of working at the higher Ka-band frequencies. This will increase the potential data throughput despite the smaller size.</p>

<p><strong>深空网络</strong>是一个用以联系航天器的全球网络设施。深空网络可以为行星际航行航天器提供通信，也可以被用来执行射电天文学和雷达天文学对于太阳系和宇宙的观测，并对地球轨道上的人造卫星提供支持。DSN目前包含三个深空通信设施，以约120度的间隔围绕着地球。每个设施皆位于半山腰、碗状地形，以帮助阻挡无线电波干扰。考虑到地球的自转，三座设施的地点以约120度的间距围绕着地球，目的是为了当地球自转时，一座设施转到背对着目标的一侧，无法进行观测时；同时另一座设施转到了可进行观测的一侧，如此DSN便能24小时持续观测目标。</p>
<h3 id="甚大规模天线阵"><a href="#甚大规模天线阵" class="headerlink" title="甚大规模天线阵"></a>甚大规模天线阵</h3><p>为满足未来数传速率不断增加的要求，一个方案是建造34m或70m直径天线，一种更经济的方案是利用大量小直径（10米级）天线组阵。利用后一种方案可以将DSN下行链路能力提高2~3个数量级，从而大大提高深空任务返回的科学数据量；可以接收更加微弱的信号，从而降低航天器上通信系统的质量和功率；将单位数据的成本降低2个数量级；与太阳系以外的航天器也可以进行高速数据通信。</p>
<h3 id="深空光学通信网"><a href="#深空光学通信网" class="headerlink" title="深空光学通信网"></a>深空光学通信网</h3><p>能将数据传输速率提高几个数量级的另一种方法是采用光通信。在光通信中，信息通过激光和望远镜传输，性能更高，而且能使航天器上的通信设备更轻巧。</p>
<p>光学空一地链路的地球端有地基和天基两种实现方案，但目前更倾向于前者。在地基方案中，采用几个10m直径的望远镜接收深空信号。而且，对光通信望远镜的性能要求远比成像望远镜的低，因此成本也低得多。由于采用带脉冲编码调制的直接探测方法，因此只需要确定光子的到达时间。</p>
<p>在地基方案中，望远镜的部署方法有两种。第一种称作“线性分散光学子网”（LDOS），即沿地球一周等间距布设6~8个光学望远镜，这就需要建立新的测站和基础设施。第二种方法称作“集群配置光学子网”（CDOS），在每个站上布设3个10m直径光学望远镜，全球共9个。</p>
<p>天基方案是在中、高地球轨道上部署光学望远镜。由于空间减少了3dB的大气信号衰减，因此光学望远镜的直径减至7m左右。但天基站的成本是地基站的8倍，而且只能同时支持一个目标。</p>
<p>JPL建立了光学通信技术实验室，研发出了1m直径光学望远镜样机进行试验。从长远来看，JPL将在大多数深空任务中采用光通信，以支持无法用射频通信满足的高速数据传输任务。</p>

          Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic RepeatsRepetitive DNA sequences, called CRISPR, were observed in bacteria with spacer DNA sequences in between the repeats that exactly match viral sequences. It was subsequently discovered that bacteria transcribe these DNA elements to RNA upon viral infection. The RNA guides a nuclease (a protein that cleaves DNA) to the viral DNA to cut it, providing protection against the virus. The nucleases are named Cas, for CRISPR-associated. 
Genome editingIn 2012, researchers demonstrated that RNAs could be constructed to guide a Cas nuclease (Cas9 was the first used) to any DNA sequence. The so-called guide RNA can also be made so that it will be specific to only that one sequence, improving the chances that the DNA will be cut at that site and nowhere else in the genome. Further testing revealed that the system works quite well in all types of cells, including human cells.
ImplicationsWith CRISPR&#x2F;Cas, it’s easy to disrupt a targeted gene, or, if a DNA template is added to the mix, insert a new sequence at the precise spot desired. The method has profoundly changed biomedical research, as it greatly reduces the time and expense of developing animal models with specific genomic changes. Scientists now routinely use the CRISPR&#x2F;Cas system for this purpose in mice. And for human diseases with a known mutation, such as cystic fibrosis, it’s theoretically possible to insert DNA that corrects the mutation. There are clinical applications in human trials now, including for engineering T cells outside of the body for CAR-T cancer therapy and for editing retinal cells for leber’s congenital amaurosis 10, an inherited form of blindness.
LimitationsCRISPR&#x2F;Cas is an extremely powerful tool, but it has important limitations. It is:

difficult to deliver the CRISPR&#x2F;Cas material to mature cells in large numbers, which remains a problem for many clinical applications. Viral vectors are the most common delivery method.
not 100% efficient, so even the cells that take in CRISPR&#x2F;Cas may not have genome editing activity.
not 100% accurate, and “off-target” edits, while rare, may have severe consequences, particularly in clinical applications.

Ethical issuesIn addition to editing somatic cells (the cells that make up most of the body), it’s possible to edit the genomes of gametes (eggs and sperm) and early embryos, called germline editing. Any such edits in humans would not only affect an individual but also his or her progeny. They could also theoretically be used to enhance desirable traits instead of curing disease. Scientists have therefore called for a moratorium on human germline editing until the serious ethical and societal implications are more fully understood.

CRISPR是存在于细菌中的一种基因，该类基因组中含有曾经攻击过该细菌的病毒的基因片段。细菌透过这些基因片段来侦测并抵抗相同病毒的攻击，并摧毁其DNA。这类基因组是细菌免疫系统的关键组成部分。透过这些基因组，人类可以准确且有效地编辑生命体内的部分基因，也就是CRISPR&#x2F;Cas基因编辑技术。
CRISPR&#x2F;Cas系统是目前发现存在于多数细菌与绝大多数的古菌中的一种后天免疫系统，以消灭外来的质粒或者噬菌体，并在自身基因组中留下外来基因片段作为“记忆”。CRISPR的全称是Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats。目前已发现三种不同类型的CRISPR&#x2F;Cas系统，存在于大约40%和90%已定序的细菌和古菌中。其中第二型的组成较为简单，以Cas9蛋白以及向导RNA（gRNA）为核心的组成。Cas9是第一个被广泛应用的CRISPR核酸酶，其次是Cpf1，其在新泽西弗朗西斯菌的CRISPR&#x2F;Cpf1系统中被发现。
由于其对DNA干扰的特性，目前被积极地应用于遗传工程中，作为基因体剪辑工具，与锌指核酸酶（ZFN）及类转录活化因子核酸酶（TALEN）同样利用非同源性末端接合（NHEJ）的机制，于基因体中产生DNA的双链断裂以利剪辑。第二型 CRISPR&#x2F;Cas经由遗传工程的改造应用于哺乳类细胞及斑马鱼的基因体剪辑。其设计简单以及操作容易的特性为最大的优点，目前已逐步应用在各种不同的模式生物当中。

The field of DNA editing and medical genetics is changing much faster than we think. AI and CRISPR technology have been making revolutionary changes to the field of medicine. Artificial Intelligence is being applied in identification of harmful genes and treatment of disease. For the specific use cases and applications and numerous the importance of AI in healthcare, and its impact on the biotech industry could grow exponentially in the near future. Multiple new gene editing technologies in addition to Artificial Intelligence will cause major changes in healthcare.


The gene editing tool CRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats could help us to reprogram life. It gives scientists more power and precision than they ever had to alter human DNA. This new power includes the possibility of making people smarter. Even before CRISPR was used on human embryos, the technology was used to modify simple animals. There the goal was to demonstrate that the technology worked these experiments made us aware that with CRISPR, we could do a lot more than we previously thought we could. Scientists use CRISPR to change delete or add DNA to any organism from a human embryo to a pig to a wheat crop. CRISPR does this by subduing a specific part of the genome and then injecting a new piece of DNA into the genome instead.


So CRISPR is an acronym for basically a system that is from bacteria, that they use to kill and destroy the DNA of invading organisms, like a virus. But we can now use that system to cut and change our own genomes, it’s basically a DNA cutting enzyme, that doesn’t cut randomly. You can give it a barcode in the form of what’s called the RNA molecule, that tells where that enzyme will cut in the genome. Let’s say you have a terrible gene that’s causing heart disease. We take this CRISPR system, we say here’s where you need to go to cut, we can tell the enzyme to go and cut it put it into your cells. It’ll go cut it and destroy that enzyme and delete it, and you can also use it to cut the genome and insert new pieces. So you can both subtract and add DNA at will now not just randomly. But what’s important is you can tell it where to go and that’s the big breakthrough.


Currently gene editing is already used in research fields such as human health, agriculture and environmental protection. However CRISPR as a tool for human genetic engineering is still in its early stage development. With the development of CRISPR as a tool for genetic engineering it is possible that more scientific advances are to come.


Let us consider the possible advantages and disadvantages of this technology. In case of diseases, CRISPR has a lot of potential advantages. CRISPR technology holds a lot of promises but we should be careful in applying it to humans animals and plants, as it may promote and accelerate some negative phenomena on the environment and on humans. Moreover many potential side effects have not been analyzed yet could it be conceivable that at one point in the future we could increase the average IQ of the population. According to UCLA neurobiologists the work in mice demonstrates the answer maybe yes.


Sometimes a person or animal is born with a mutation in their genome, these mutations can be small or large, and they can have many different effects, such mutations are often purposeless or random and they can have no effect on our intelligence. This shown by the fact that gene mutations that happened millions of years ago, are still present in the genes of living organisms on earth. Evolution has had plenty of time to correct them and eradicate them, but many of them are still there.


In fact many of the mutations that show up in human DNA are harmful, the apparently large genetic contribution has detrimental effects on everyday life. Ranging from a person being slightly more vulnerable to certain diseases to mental retardation to causing death immediately after birth. CRISPR technology in the future could enable efficient and affordable treatment of diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy or even rheumatoid arthritis.


We believe we understand how to slow aging, there are genes that predispose you to a long life. We could make offspring a family that would potentially live a lot longer, actually there are drugs that are in development to actually correct genetic diseases such as vision loss. What we’re showing is in mice at least we can reverse the age of the retina, and restore the vision of old mice. So we’d reprogram the eye to be young again. So we now know that there’s a set of genes called reprogramming factors also known as Yamanaka factors that are from named after this Japanese fellow, who won the Nobel prize in 2012. These factors are used all over the world even to reprogram skin cells other cells to be what we call pluripotent stem cells. These are cells that can be used to make new organs or new blood cells. But what people hadn’t tried until recently was can you do this in a living animal, or are you just going to mess it u. And what we found out is that if you do it the wrong way you mess up the animal and it’ll die. But what we’ve shown for the first time in this paper is you can do it in a safe way, and not only that reverse the clock make the cells young and restore how they work, and get back vision.


CRISPR was originally designed as a technique for editing the DNA in living organisms but its uses and capabilities have expanded substantially it is now used wildly for biomedical research including research into human genetics. One of the main issues concerning technologies such as CRISPR-cas9 is accuracy and safety. As mistakes can have significant and dangerous consequences when it comes to an individual’s genome. However CRISPR technology has a lot of potential benefits. It is not a completely new idea and it can help treat diseases and genetic anomalies and many scientists have made potential progress that CRISPR cache 9 may be safer than viral therapies.


Many people have expressed concerns about crest by technologies because they think it is incredibly controversial. There are questions of ethics and fairness as it could probably only be available to the wealthy, to create designer babies with increased levels of intelligence. Intelligence is too complex to engineer, however many researchers think that intelligence is influenced by genes and environment. Genes affect the developing baby’s brain and environmental factors influence how the brain is used, thus it is possible that genetically engineered babies could be smarter as a result of the increased amount of oxygen to the developing brain, thanks to gene editing. Research experiments already exist that creates smart mouse babies. Question is whether it is going to be possible to accomplish the same with human beings.


And in the mice, to restore the vision we have this three gene combination of these Yamanaka reprogramming genes. We put them into the eye and then we turn them on with a drug called doxycycline is the same drug we can feed to the mice turns on the reprogramming genes for a few weeks, restores their vision back to a young mouse, and then we just take away the doxycycline and antibiotic, and the mice have their vision back. That’s the future, that you’ll get a delivery of this virus, you’ll take the antibiotic for a few weeks be fully rejuvenated, and the doctor says come back in a couple of decades we’ll fix you again. I’ll give you some antibiotics in a couple of decades but then it gets really weird if you have if you engineer your children to have this system, and you have people engineered to be able to be reversed in their age. Or let’s say they have an accident, and their optic nerve gets damaged or they lose their hearing, give them a dose of an IV of antibiotics, and they become just like an embryo, they can rejuvenate, they can regrow their optic nerve, regrow their spine fixed back like new.


It may be possible that in the future, our genealogical records might be included in computer databases, and future computer programs could use it. The advancements in Artificial Intelligence and CRISPR technology can make it possible to one day, create a new breed of human machine hybrids, however the question concerning the safety of such technique in relation to humans is ongoing. We do not fully understand all the mechanisms related to the editing of the human genome. Additionally the long-term and short-term effects of the gene editing interventions in humans are still unclear.


CRISPR has given the scientific community a great leap. The prospect of improving our understanding of the genome will likely stimulate advances in both Artificial Intelligence and predictive medicine. The possibility of altering the sequences of genes and correcting the mistakes that were previously irreversible, opens many new possibilities for research. Nevertheless for now genetic editing technology is still incapable of making the hundreds of changes presumably necessary to make a super intelligent human, but the corresponding ethical issues deserve serious attention before these capabilities become a reality.

          A private jet, business jet, or bizjet is a jet aircraft designed for transporting small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, government officials or the armed forces.
Most production business jets use two jet engines as a compromise between the operating economy of fewer engines and the ability to safely continue flight after an engine failure. Exceptions include the early Lockheed Jetstar with four engines; the Dassault Falcon 50 and derivatives with three; and the Cirrus Vision SF50 with one, a configuration also used in several similar very light jet design concepts. Most business jets use podded engines mounted on the rear fuselage with a cruciform tail or T-tail to reduce interference drag and increase exhaust clearance.
Practical limits on the ground clearance of these smaller aircraft have prompted designers to avoid the common jetliner configuration of a low wing with underslung podded engines. The sole business jet to use this layout, the early McDonnell 119, was rejected by the USAF due to foreign object damage concerns, leading to the failure of the program. The recent HondaJet uses wing-mounted engines but mitigates this problem with its unique over-the-wing engine pods.
As with jetliners, swept wings are often used to increase cruise speed, but straight wings are also commonplace; notably, Cessna deliberately prioritized docile low-speed handling in choosing straight wings for many models in its popular Citation family, envisioning that owners transitioning from slower piston engined or turboprop aircraft would want to maintain the ability to use relatively short runways, and that lower approach speeds would ease single-pilot operations, particularly by relatively inexperienced owner-pilots.
Rolls-Royce plc powers over 3,000 business jets, 42% of the fleet: all the Gulfstreams and Bombardier Globals, the Cessna Citation X and Embraer Legacy 600, early Hawkers, and many small jets with the Williams-Rolls FJ44.

和航空公司的客机出售机票给个别乘客不同，商务喷气式飞机若为私人所有，通常称为私人喷气式飞机；若为企业所有，则称为公司喷气式飞机。除了上述的营运形式外，也有专门从事商务喷气式飞机出租服务的专门业者；向这些公司租用商务喷气式飞机，则又可称为包机（Charter）。
对于超级富豪而言，专用的商务喷气式飞机可能又无法满足其要求，因此将大型客机作内部改装，成为私人喷气式飞机，就是最佳选择。如空中客车的新一代大型客机A380，已经有不愿披露身份中东地区富豪，以1.5亿英磅购机，再花7千5百万英磅进行内部装修。
对于一般富人及企业，多选择使用商务喷气式飞机公司专门出厂的商务喷气式飞机，如庞巴迪宇航的环球系列、挑战者系列，湾流航太的G系列，达索航空的猎鹰系列，安博威的领航系列、飞鸿系列，德事隆航空的赛斯纳奖状系列等等。

Depending on size, range, model and features, a private jet can set you back anywhere from two million dollars to over 100 million dollars. Much like used cars, private jets are subject to serious depreciation. If you’re looking for a bargain second-hand jets come much cheaper first on your expense list is the purchase price. A new gulfstream G450, for example, can cost anywhere between 38 and 43 million dollars brand new depending on the upgrades, you add at the time of purchase on the other hand a pre-owned model will typically cost you anywhere in the 14 million to 35 million dollar range. A significant variance depending on the flight hours upgrades and features that are on the aircraft. As mentioned earlier the cost can go as high as your pockets can allow you.


Let’s outline ownership starting small. In recent decades the VLJ (very light jet) became an entry-level category of the private jet marketplace, made possible with small and economical engines, such as the william FJ series VLJs are not as popular as they were predicted to be this is greatly due to the slower speeds and limited load capacity. The cirrus vision SF-50, the cheapest of the VLJs as a single williams FJ33 jet engine cruises at 300 knots and can seat seven including the cockpit seats in tight quarters. The entry price is competitive around two million dollars brand new. At the other end of the spectrum larger more powerful private jets can reach into the hundreds of millions. For example, the super long range BBJ 777x can seat up to 75 guests will set you back upwards of 400 million dollars. While the initial purchase fee may seem steep, many owners find that the real cost of owning a private jet comes later on. Unlike when chartering a jet owning one, leaves you responsible for the ongoing expenses associated with regularly flying a jet customization tops the priority list.


You see, when you have the kind of money that allows you to indulge in such expensive spending, one tends to develop a unique appetite that of rarity. With that most jet owners likely making their flying paradises match their taste. When buying a new jet as the owner, you’ll be able to design the interiors as you please, while a jet can be left as configured many buyers will choose to redesign, be it just adding a personal touch to the decor or completely altering the layout. Of course customization will come at a cost with some private jet owners, spending upwards of 100 million dollars on bespoke plane interiors like prince Al-Waleed or former POTUS Donald Trump. The private jet crew is another area a willing owner will have to flex their financial muscles, advanced as they can be business jets can’t fly themselves.


A private jet owner will need to hire an onboard crew including a pilot, if they are not qualified to fly themselves. The cost will vary depending on the crew and number of flying hours. But jet owners should anticipate paying anything from two hundred fifty thousand dollars per year. If one pilot is paid a two hundred fifty thousand dollar salary, for example, you’ll need to pay that plus benefits and depending on the size of the plane, and how often you fly it you’ll likely need two or three pilots, that would bring the total annual cost of the pilots alone to over 750 thousand dollars. But it may be difficult even to find a pilot, many pilots are reportedly switching to flying commercial airlines, where they can get better pay and more regular working hours.


A professional pilot is a necessary extension to any aircraft, but equally important is the private jet flight attendant to enhance the safe environment during a flight. While not required under FAA regulation, a private jet flight attendant more commonly referred to as cabin attendant is an essential component of a flight department’s operations. Cabin attendants are the anticipatory adaptable elegant detail-oriented, and multi-talented safety, and service professionals for a private jet. Behind the scenes cabin attendants work tirelessly to create an experience, that owners and charter guests rave over. However it is the extensive safety training required for cabin attendants to compete, that makes the ultimate difference for clients and aircraft owners.


For ultra luxury air travel world-class, cabin attendants go through educational courses that include water evacuations and emergency drills, CPR and first AiD certifications, as well as advanced culinary and etiquette preparation, their salaries range anywhere from forty to fifty thousand dollars a year. The maintenance cost of a jet is another financial draining area. Regardless of where and how frequently you intend to fly, jet owners are faced with substantial ongoing expenses, beginning with routine maintenance and on-the-ground downtime. Regularly flying through the sky at over 500 miles an hour, will inevitably leave your private jet open to some wear and tear. 


General maintenance should be performed regularly. While unexpected repairs should also be budgeted for. The cost will vary depending on the model as well as the nature of the repair. But even seemingly small issues such as a cracked window can cost tens of thousands of dollars. A blown tire can cost two thousand to three thousand dollars to replace, then there’s insurance. Let’s figure hull insurance at thirty four thousand five hundred twenty dollars, and a single limited liability at twelve thousand five hundred dollars for a rounded total of forty seven thousand dollars. However it’s important to note that insurance can increase based on several factors not limited to average flight hours, age of the aircraft and more and as the jets get bigger and carry a higher payload. You can almost count on a larger premium.


Private jet insurance policies include liability coverage which covers your legal liability in the event that property damage or bodily injury occurs as a result of the operation of your jet aircraft. Then comes the fuel consumption fuel is one of the biggest expenditures when it comes to the cost of owning a private jet. With jet fuel currently priced at around two dollars and twenty five cents to five dollars and fifty cents per gallon, although fuel consumption will vary depending on onboard weight and flying speed.


Larger planes such as the gulfstream G700 can burn through 380 gallons an hour. Putting your minimum hourly fuel costs at over 850 bucks. This means that if you’re flying for 300 hours a year, you should expect to pay upwards of 256 thousand dollars in jet fuel. Finally there are the hangar fees airplanes are generally one of the most expensive assets, an individual owned and are also somewhat of an oddity, well very strong and durable in flight they are downright fragile on the ground. A private aircraft that careens through known icing and turbulence in flight, without any issue can be completely destroyed on the ground due to gusting wind. Rain and ultraviolet rays take a toll on aircraft causing serious damage to them if left in the elements. But what are the options available to hanger an aircraft and what are the actual costs of an airplane hangar. When you’re paying this much for the privilege of owning a jet, it needs to be stored carefully when not in use. Unless you have the space in your garage, you’ll have to rent or buy a space in an airport hangar. Depending on the hangar location, renting a private hangar will be around three thousand dollars per month.


As you can see there are several options for those fortunate enough to purchase a private aircraft. Whether you purchase new or used is clearly a matter of personal preference and budgetary constraints. Considering all the extra fees on top of the initial purchase it costs an impressive amount to own a private jet with yearly maintenance and operation, costs heading into the hundreds of thousands. To make the price worth it a jet owner should anticipate flying at least 100 hours a year over the course of four to five years. If you don’t plan to fly this frequently, fractional ownership in which you buy shares of an aircraft is likely to be a more cost effective way to enjoy private aviation.

          A spaceship is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space. A type of artificial satellite, spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spaceship except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier rocket).
On a sub-orbital spaceflight, a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface, without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make a full orbit of the Earth. For orbital spaceflights, spaceship enter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies. spaceship used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic spaceship used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic spaceship that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites. To date, only a handful of interstellar probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, are on trajectories that leave the Solar System.
Orbital spaceship may be recoverable or not. Most are not. Recoverable spaceship may be subdivided by method of reentry to Earth into non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes. Recoverable spaceship may be reusable (can be launched again or several times, like the SpaceX Dragon and the Space Shuttle orbiters) or expendable (like the Soyuz). In recent years, we are seeing more space agencies tending towards reusable spaceship.

星际飞船（spacecraft，spaceship），是一种运送航天员、货物到达太空并安全返回的航天器。星际飞船可分为一次性使用与可重复使用两种类型。用运载火箭把飞船送入地球卫星轨道运行，然后再入大气层。飞船上除有一般人造卫星基本系统设备外，还有生命维持系统、重返地球的再入系统，回收登陆系统等。

The trick to designing any machine, especially a spaceship, is knowing what its purpose and mission are… unfortunately science fiction provides us with few ships designed with those concepts in mind.


So today we’ll be looking at spaceship design from modern ships to those of the distant future, to some that might never exist outside of science fiction. We’ll also be deconstructing some sci-fi designs to see if they really make that much sense, and [a] examining some real-world design elements that are specific only to modern spaceship. Right now every spaceship is designed to be as light as possible, because every kilogram costs a lot of money to get into space.


Also, spaceship are most commonly lost in the launch phase, so if you want to assemble a bigger ship or station in orbit, you need a lot of launches, each of which might blow up on the pad or shortly after launch, and even for automated launches, that results in in missions exceeding budgets and introducing big delays. And so, in modern space exploration, if you can make a hammer that weighs half as much but costs a hundred times as much, you send that expensive hammer up instead of the cheaper and heavier one.


The major paradigms of modern spaceship design are extreme quality control, ultra-reliability, and the minimization of your mass, because failure is not an option. If a rare manufacturing defect in a half-penny resistor can disable a circuit that disables your $100 million probe, you’ll spend thousands of dollars making sure that half-penny resistor works right. This stands in contrast to the standards to which most mass produced items are held, where cost usually is a bigger concern than reliability or redundancy. You generally don’t pay 10 times as much for an appliance that will last twice as long or is half as likely to malfunction.


As a result, our perception and attitude towards modern terrestrial industry can warp our understanding of spaceship design. A good example is addressing the issue of radiation. Most spaceship rely on thin, but dense, shielding made usually of lead, gold foil or water, but other materials such as uranium can work as well. Thick shielding adds cost due to the weight, for fairly little added benefit. Another thing we have to consider is that not all of the ship needs to be shielded, only the areas which have vulnerable computer systems or lifeforms do, which saves on weight and cost.


We can also look to technological solutions to eliminate the cost and weight of shielding. For example, magnetic fields strengthened with ionized gases like xenon have been proposed for shielding against cosmic radiation, as they are able to deflect charged particles away from the crew. However these also come with trade offs - such a device consumes more power, so you have to have a bigger power source, which means more mass as well.


Of course, a more efficient power source can help solve that issue, and a total and cheap cure for cancer would minimize the need for shielding humans too. A different approach is to incorporate other components of your mass into your shielding. For example, water is a fantastic radiation shield - that’s one reason why we use it to shield radioactive material here on earth; you can design a spaceship’s storage for water and waste to double as your radiation shielding. Aerogels also offer a lightweight approach to shielding while having a minimal effect on mass, though the larger or faster the projectile, the thicker the layer of aerogel or the incorporation of a denser layer working in tandem.


Of course, if you’ve already well established yourself in space, and need to protect habitats’ long term inhabitants from radiation, you can always simply pile mass around your habitat. An established space industry can take advantage of low-gravity bodies like small moons or asteroids to save on launch costs, making thicker shielding practical. Some of our habitats and spaceship are likely to be built into existing small, rocky bodies as well, which will mean they come with their own free shielding. Perhaps the most important factor though, especially for spaceships, is the square-cube law.


If you make something bigger by simply expanding its geometry, the surface area will rise with the square of that increase while the volume rises with the cube of that value. Double a sphere’s radius, and it has four times the surface area, but eight times the volume. Make a cylinder ten times bigger along its long axis and radius, and it gets a hundred times the surface area and a thousand times the volume. If we want a space station that can hold a thousand times as much cargo or personnel, we make it ten times bigger, which also gives it a hundred times the surface area, and by default a thousand times the mass. But it’s not really necessary to make my shielding ten times as thick, we only need to extend it over one hundred times as much area, and now shielding accounts for a tenth the proportional mass that it did on the smaller version. And many other aspects of my ship also won’t need to scale up by 1000 either. So, I probably don’t need a thousand times as many spare parts for instance, even if I do need a thousand times as many components – which I probably wouldn’t anyways. You will always need two of any critical component or part, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you need two-thousand of them just because you have a thousand times as much space. For spaceships, bigger is often better. In other words, once you start making ships of a certain size, even if mass is still a big concern, radiation shielding really stops being an issue.


Even on interstellar ships plowing through the void at relativistic speeds, you really only need to increase your shielding on the nose of the craft. The easiest way to do this is to simply keep your spare fuel and water supply up front to soak up radiation. Hydrogen and water ice mostly won’t be harmed by it, and they will be stored in thick volumes, so you can design long and skinny ships with the front, thick shielding being proportionally smaller, reducing how much proportional mass you’re pushing around. So that’s our most likely layout for spaceships, they are skinny and long. This does not necessarily mean you build ships like long, ultra-thin wires, but you will generally want to optimize the shape of your spaceship by employing a minimum longitudinal cross-section.


A spear, needle, or arrow shape is preferred, not a blocky one. Generally it would be symmetric too, though they don’t necessarily need to be aerodynamic. There’s no air in space to cause drag; however, if you’re moving at highly relativistic speeds, the near-vacuum of the interstellar medium actually acts like a gas, though we’ll come back to that later. With that in mind you could easily introduce a lot of protrusions such as antennae, shielding, extra habitation pods, and so on, which destroys the image of a nice, sleek hull. Not every location or area on a ship needs the same level of protection, for example, you don’t particularly care if a random bit of space debris slams into an antenna, as such hardware is easily replaced or can even be manufactured on the ship. Indeed you might use less armor and shielding on spare water and fuel tanks to ensure any debris doesn’t fragment upon impact. That could cause a large exit wound, and which means your fuel or water will be lost to the void. If you can ensure debris only punches a small hole in those tanks, the leakage could be kept minimal during the tiny amount of time it would take to patch that small puncture, especially if you have a self-sealing material for the tanks. Indeed, perhaps such a self-sealing tank might leak an average of a few hundred kilograms to these minor punctures during the voyage.


However, if you were to use a more heavily armored tank, you’d have to attach many thousands of kilograms of additional armor, adding to your ship’s mass, and increasing your fuel bill. In this case, you’d want to go with the thinner tanks and just absorb the minor losses, because it’s an overall net gain. You are also very likely to have a lot of modular, reconfigurable, or retractable segments or pods on your ship. During the ship’s construction, you won’t be fighting air resistance or the drag of gravity, but once you embark on your journey, during your acceleration phases, you will effectively be back under gravity’s thumb. Of course the robustness of your ship design will need to consider the level of acceleration, and deceleration you intend to use. Short trips may accelerate harder for a brief time, whereas longer journeys may opt for a protracted, but lower and more efficient acceleration. Once the acceleration phase ends and you begin your coasting phase, which will be the majority of your trip, there’s no reason why you can’t begin to expand outward, adding segments and pods and extrusions of all types, but this must be measured against the fact that you will be increasing your ship’s cross section. If you wish to expand, you must decide how much radiation shielding and anti-collision armor you’ll give to each extrusion.


However, while you’re cruising, you even have the option to trail things behind your ship; maybe you detach your power generator and instead drag it behind you, apart from the ship, so whatever waste it produces can be ejected into space, instead of remaining part of your ship’s mass. You can reel the reactor back in when it’s time to fire your engines for your deceleration phase. There’s also the option to trail a radiator behind you, to help dissipate the excess heat all of your shipboard activities will generate. Indeed, interstellar craft might sport many thin radiating fins protruding from the hull. You could even add things to the front – radar, anti-collision lasers, or thin sails sent drifting in front of you to absorb collisions and minimize damage to the actual ship.


But then again, maybe not, because while losing an antenna or radiating fin or a few scraps of a thin fuel or water tank might not be a big deal, the fact is that the debris destroying your antennae is moving extremely fast, relative to your ship. Even small pebble- or sand grain-sized particles are essentially bombs at interplanetary speeds - and at interstellar speeds, those grains are atomic bombs. Any ships coming into an inhabited system might need to retract such flimsy protuberances. Should a radiating fin or antenna be knocked off your ship by interplanetary debris, at the speed you’ll be moving, even as you decelerate from interstellar speeds into the system, your lost equipment just became an entire nuclear arsenal’s worth of kinetic energy, rocketing towards your intended destination. Just imagine some space freighter decelerating into a densely inhabited system; it would be disastrous to essentially nuke the world you spent decades, or even centuries, to reach, with a loose or broken piece of hardware – so all of your protuberances and extrusions need to be pulled in to minimize your ship’s cross section again when you are in a system, in interplanetary areas. Unless of course you are an invading fleet, in which case all that potential debris becomes your target’s problem rather than yours.


Though speaking of space freighters, those are probably one of those things you’d only see in science fiction - specifically of the giant mega-freighters plowing through deep space variety. There’s plenty of room for freighters, but if we’re talking about moving large quantities of raw materials around, realistically, those huge container freighters really aren’t the best way to ship your resources. Instead, you’d attach a small ship to a large payload, essentially a slowboat, meekly cruising back towards the world or habitat or station that requires the materials, taking many years to arrive. A megaton of iron is just as valuable when it is on its way as it is the moment you acquire it. Let’s consider 3 likely cargos of raw materials one might haul around in the future. Ice, Gas, and metal ores. Let’s start with ice. Water in any form is rare in the inner system – outside of Earth, of course – but out past the asteroid belt, past the “frost line,” there are innumerable icy bodies, asteroids, comets, and ice-covered moons around the gas giants. This makes the concept of transporting large quantities of water very logical; if you’re building rotating habitats in the inner system, you’ll need that water to be shipped in. However, those icy bodies aren’t entirely pure water ice  –  they typically also contain chemicals such as frozen ammonia, methane, and so on  –  a little perk, resources that can be put to other uses. If your ship’s job is pushing ice out from Saturn’s Rings or the Kuiper Belt, that’s exactly what you would do: push it. You wouldn’t cut the icy body into pieces and haul them into a massive freighter, you’d simply attach your ship, which is probably rather small, to the icy body and use your engines to accelerate the body towards your destination.


However, you really aren’t just shoving the cargo – you don’t want to send a comet rocketing into the inner system on a ballistic trajectory. You will probably arrive at the ice with equipment that is basically a set of extra engines and a protective wrap. As you push the ice in-system, if it is unprotected, it will start to melt and outgas – which is what gives us those beautiful comet tails we all know. So you’ll want to wrap the ice in some sort of thermal protection – something that will keep the ice cold and frozen even as you approach the warmer inner system. You’ll want the wrap to maintain some pressure inside, so that any phase changes that do occur will be the ice melting into a liquid, instead of sublimating into a vapor. The wrap will also probably be reflective, especially to infrared radiation. While comets are beautiful to see, in this situation, we definitely want to avoid losing all that precious water. However, any sublimation and outgassing could make handy propellants to push that comet around, and an alternative to wrapping the comet. You could follow the comet closely and collect the gas and vapor so you don’t lose those resources to the vacuum. Once collected, you have many options for using these gasses: process the mix and separate all the molecules. Electrolyze the water to get the hydrogen to dump into your fusion drive or reactor. Or perhaps your ship has great mirrors or solar sails, which you can use to reflect and focus an energy beam at the comet to sublimate the ice into natural propellant. This superheated gas and vapor would push the comet in-system quite powerfully, and would get to its destination more quickly.


However, this method requires some decision making; how much of that material are you willing to lose in order to get the comet to its destination faster? You might of course do this entirely automated, but if you need on-site crew, they need a place to live, and you’re never going to be in a rush on ice, since the slower you go the higher your profit, minus the cost of salaries and equipment maintenance, which I’d imagine will be the dominant factors in deciding how slow you can push ice. They’re going to want to make a bit of a home out of that place, and of course might carve in ice tunnels or extract minerals to build more stuff – icy bodies typically have plenty of rock mixed in there too. This gets one thinking about ore freighters as well. Now you might opt to move a metal or carbon rich asteroid this same way. If that’s the case, given that many a freighter or colony ship might also be a mobile refinery and factory, they might not be moving raw materials but instead be making stuff out of them or refining as they go. I should also note that ship hulls and space habitat hulls are likely to be fairly generic, so you might start moving an asteroid and turning bits of it into a ship plating and end with a classic big space freighter full of a mix of ore, refined metal, and manufactured goods, all surrounded by cheap, standardized hull plating you could also sell at your destination.


One-use freighters in a sense, with a core ship for the crew and sophisticated components you couldn’t make en route. As to moving gas, the reality is that you probably would not, in favor of pressurizing and cooling it enough to be a liquid or solid. A great big balloon is going to leak on you, both from all the extra debris it might be punctured by from its larger size, and because any container has to be able to keep tiny gas molecules from slipping through, and that’s very hard to do with hydrogen for instance since its smaller than the atoms of the container material. So a gas freighter might end up looking a bit more like our classic image as it probably would be a ton of tanks filled with gas or liquid strapped to a ship. That crew doesn’t really need much room compared to the sizes involved, especially in terms of the habitat drum. This is all assuming you even need a crew but as we often mention on this show, the concept of a sophisticated ship computer able to replace a human crew doesn’t necessarily mean its ‘unmanned’. By and large you don’t need much brains for navigating space but many of the other tasks might start edging into an area where you need something animal-smart, and if it needs human-smart, you use a human. Or a person anyway, even if they might never have been born in the classic sense.


Artificial intelligence is a rather vague concept when you get to higher levels. Whether it’s an unmanned ship or a manned one, and for all the vagueness of that term in a futuristic sense, a ship is always going to have a computer on board. What else does it need? Well air and water and warmth if anything biological is in play, and a means to clean and recycle both. It’s tempting to assume spaceships will always have gardens or hydroponics onboard if people are on board, but plants aren’t the most mass-efficient way to scrub carbon dioxide out of the air. Short-run ships or those that need to accelerate fast like a warship probably wouldn’t bother. For everyone else, it offers at least a supplement of fresh food and something green to look at. Your crew needs to bring some home along though, and will always try to, within the limitations of the ship and mission. A ship that needs to be able to accelerate very fast and suddenly might have problems keeping a garden or hydroponics bay going so it doesn’t get smashed around by the sudden jerks or effective high-gravity, but I suspect that would simply results in lots of inventions to make it practical rather than abstaining from having them. When it comes to living quarters, ‘as close to home as possible’ will always apply, and where it can’t we either do our best, go without, or modify ourselves for it to not matter. That could be a minor thing like everyone wearing sunglasses and sunscreen because the ship or work environment in space was heavily flooded with UV light, or more likely the reverse, having sunrooms you could sit in that let you soak up the rays while the ship tended to be otherwise dim. Alternatively it could be big stuff like modifying a human to not need gravity, or handle gravity and acceleration better, or even uploading minds into computers or cyborgs to handle extreme conditions like acceleration or radiation.


Ships that spend a lot of time cruising or only undergo weak long accelerations like an ion drive , rather than fast burns like chemical rockets, are generally going to be able to have a much more regular layout of things like dining and food preparation and bathrooms and gardens. Alternatively, ships that do have to be ready for rapid burns need to have very specialized and specific places for eating, drinking, disposing of waste, and even sleeping. You might need to strap in. If the ship needs to be able to rapidly accelerate on short notice, you need padded walls or airbags in them, because a sudden 5-g burn might slam someone into the ceiling or wall of a corridor hard enough to shatter their bones. You might go the other way though and include padded suits instead, or pad objects that might not be secured. Pet collars on such a maneuverable spaceship, and I’m sure most with crews would have pets too, would likely feature air bags or balloons that could act as impromptu life support bubbles. Amusingly a coffee cup might have an accelerometer in it that triggered a lid and blew out a balloon, many tools might too. We often see boarding parties in science fiction fighting through corridors, but less so debris bouncing around or the combatants trying to blast or squirm through corridors that have blown out airbags down their length. On any such ship though, every bit of equipment is going to be secured when not in use and likely attached to tethers even when in use. A hammer or screwdriver kicked down a corridor by a rapid burn is a lethal object. Such ships wouldn’t have large rotating sections much either. We often picture stations or ships that provide gravity by rotation as being the whole thing rotating, but as we’ve noted in other episodes, usually the rotating section would be inside a larger superstructure, and on a ship, except a classic slowboat generation ark ship, that rotating drum is likely to be only a small part. They are a place for sleeping and relaxation or stationary work, like offices, kitchens, or workshops.


A ship doesn’t have to have only one drum though, it can have several of various sizes, even nested inside each other and providing different levels of gravity. Your issue there is that the smaller in diameter a drum is, the more times per minute it needs to rotate to produce the same gravity. Evidence suggests 2 RPM is beneath our threshold to feel nauseous but more RPMs are probably easy to acclimate to. That limits how small a drum can be, though it can be smaller if you don’t need full gravity and odds are some small workshop in a distant corner of a ship only needs enough gravity so stuff falls and things feel up and down, moon gravity might be enough. Propulsion is important for how a ship will be laid out inside, but of course it’s a big deal for overall ship configuration too. Indeed in the case of a ship attempting to achieve high delta-v, meaning a high cruise velocity, the so-called propulsion bus may have to represent the bulk of total mass: the “payload”, where you’d have crew quarters, cargo and life support, would look relatively small even if it’s in the thousands of tons, and it would be dwarfed by the engines, waste heat removal systems &#x2F; radiators, and the fuel tanks, which may be the largest part of the ship, to obtain a high mass ratio. Let’s talk a little more about streamlining the outside of ships though. For the most part, as I mentioned earlier, ships don’t need be streamlined other than to cut down on overall mass and cross section, and might feature a lot of retractable equipment in exterior bays so you could store them under more cover when not in use and make it easier to get at them for repairs, be it antennas or radiators or sensors or big point-defense guns. We’ve got some special cases for streamlining though. Needless to say if you want your ship to be able to land on a planet or move into a gas giant it needs streamlining. Such ships have an excuse for more of the jet or plane look, as they have to deal with lift since they are going through air and gravity fields.


However space is not a true vacuum and at high enough speeds even in intergalactic space, as close to true vacuum as you can get outside a lab, it can act like air giving drag and friction, though not lift, or much anyway. If you’re flying above a galaxy at ultra-relativistic speeds you might get a tiny amount of lift you needed to account for. This does mean relativistic ships want to have a nose on them, so that if stuff hits, it deflects away, rather than just impacting against a flat wall. Of course at such speeds even a grain of sand is like a big bomb but it still helps to have that nose-cone, and I was apparently rather unintentionally ambiguous about that in our Interstellar Travel Challenges episode where we looked at the issues and options for ships moving at a decent percentage of light speed. I also mentioned there that you probably would never want to build a ship that ever went anywhere near light speed, but there are cases and setups where that would make sense. All the gas and dust lying around will be acting as drag, and even a ship with infinite fuel, either by some magic clarketech or by a pushing laser, will eventually reach a maximum speed where the ship drive or pushing laser equals out in thrust to the drag of the interstellar or intergalactic medium Even if you do reach highly relativistic speeds, you have a new problem, because even if you can clear out every speck of debris in front of you, that ambient radiation everywhere in the universe becomes a problem.


A really skinny ship with a magic stardrive can potentially get insanely fast, but would rely on technology we have not even an inkling of yet, and maybe ever. A pushing laser can be done though but introduces a new problem. A great big sail or mirror on the back also massively increases your ships cross section. The better you can focus that beam the smaller that cross section can be, but even if you can pull off a long relay of pushing stations so the beam is always tight, you still get an issue with light red shifting, and blue shifting. The faster you’re going, the more red-shifted the pushing beam will be, and thus the weaker it is and the less thrust it offers. On the flip side, all the ambient radiation you’re plowing through will be more blue shifted, and thus provide more thrust against you. Inside a galaxy this radiation drag is going to be way less than from all the gas and dust, even keeping in mind that there’s a lot more ambient radiation from all those stars.


Out in the intergalactic void though you still have to tackle Cosmic Background Microwave Radiation, which is evenly dispersed everywhere. Far, far in the distant future this will grow ever weaker, as it redshifts as the Universe expands, but right now it places a barrier at about a gamma of 133, according to calculations by Colin McInnes in his book “Solar Sailing”, where the red shifted pushing beam and the blue-shifted CMB radiation equalize out. Gamma by the way is the term for the Lorentz-factor in Special Relativity, we’ve discussed that more in other episodes but for a quick abridged version, this is how much time slows down for you relative to the outside universe or how much of your total energy is in kinetic motion rather than mass energy. A gamma of 133 would mean 133 seconds would pass on other people’s clocks for every second you experienced, or basically a bit over two minutes for each of your seconds. It also means you’d be moving at 99.9972% of light speed. In other words, if you were making the trip to the Andromeda Galaxy at this speed, 2.5 million light years away, you would personally experience only 19,000 years on the voyage. At that speed incidentally the light from any signal sent when you left would only arrive about a century before you on your 2.5 million year journey.


I doubt you could ever get to that speed, but it does mean that even if you do, your intergalactic crews still either need radical life extension or very-multi-generation-ships for the trips. Even frozen crews, as we mentioned in Sleeper Ships, need special measures to be taken to avoid being killed by buildup of radiation damage from the tiny amounts given off by the radioactive potassium isotopes in your bones and other isotopes in your body. Such ships can start slowing by just cutting off their pushing laser. Slowing down cost fuel and energy, so you want to get all the freebies you can, and at these speeds you’d start by slowing using ambient blue-shifted energy, then cosmic gas and dust, then hopefully by vanguard probes hitting stars ahead of you and building pushing lasers to slow you, using the technique we discussed in Exodus Fleet.


Magnetic sails can also help you with deceleration, their effectiveness increases with initial speed, and even today’s proposed designs could allow a braking rate of several milligees, though it may be less in intergalactic space due to its lesser density. The faster you’re going though, the more each mote of dust or photon you collide with reduces your speed, and here we see yet again how much ship design has to vary with things specific to purpose rather than technology available let alone any constant rules of ship design that apply across all levels of mission purpose, technology, and aesthetics. I’ll also note though before we close out that what we think of as a cool looking spaceship, or machine, often is altered by our exposure to it. When you get around to a rocket or a jet or a sportscar don’t look that particularly awesome until you know what they can do, and your mind tends to start altering what you think is cool to look at. Your default spaceship is likely to look a lot more boring and plain than what we see in scifi, but our descendants in the future might think those designs look pretty cool.

          Jet engines, which are also called gas turbines, work by sucking air into the front of the engine using a fan. From there, the engine compresses the air, mixes fuel with it, ignites the fuel&#x2F;air mixture, and shoots it out the back of the engine, creating thrust.
A turbofan engine, sometimes referred to as a fanjet or bypass engine, is a jet engine variant which produces thrust using a combination of jet core efflux and bypass air which has been accelerated by a ducted fan that is driven by the jet core.

The FanThe first part of the turbofan is the fan. It’s also the part that you can see when you’re looking at the front of a jet.
The fan, which almost always is made of titanium blades, sucks in tremendous quantities of air into the engine.
The air moves through two parts of the engine. Some of the air is directed into the engine’s core, where the combustion will occur. The rest of the air, called “bypass air”, is moved around the outside of the engine core through a duct. This bypass air creates additional thrust, cools the engine, and makes the engine quieter by blanketing the exhaust air that’s exiting the engine. In today’s modern turbofans, bypass air produces the majority of an engine’s thrust.
The CompressorThe compressor is located in the first part of the engine core. And it, as you probably have guessed, compresses the air.
The compressor, which is called an “axial flow compressor”, uses a series of airfoil-shaped spinning blades to speed up and compress the air. It’s called axial flow, because the air passes through the engine in a direction parallel to the shaft of the engine (as opposed to centrifugal flow).
As the air moves through the compressor, each set of blades is slightly smaller, adding more energy and compression to the air.
In between each set of compressor blades are non-moving airfoil-shaped blades called “stators”. These stators (which are also called vanes), increase the pressure of the air by converting the rotational energy into static pressure. The stators also prepare the air for entering the next set of rotating blades. In other words, they “straighten” the flow of air.
When combined, a pair of rotating and stationary blades is called a stage.
The CombustorThe case contains all the parts of the combustor, and inside it, the diffuser is the first part that does work.
The diffuser slows down the air from the compressor, making it easier to ignite. The dome and swirler add turbulence to the air so it can more easily mix with fuel. And the fuel injector, as you probably guessed, sprays fuel into the air, creating a fuel&#x2F;air mixture that can be ignited.
From there, the liner is where the actual combustion happens. The liner has several inlets, allowing air to enter at multiple points in the combustion zone.
The last main part is the igniter, which is very similar to the spark plugs in your car or piston-engine airplane. Once the igniter lights the fire, it is self-sustaining, and the igniter is turned off (although it’s often used as a back-up in bad weather and icing conditions).
The TurbineOnce the air makes its way through the combustor, it flows through the turbine. The turbine is a series of airfoil-shaped blades that are very similar to the blades in the compressor. As the hot, high-speed air flows over the turbine blades, they extract energy from the air, spinning the turbine around in a circle, and turning the engine shaft that it’s connected to.The combustor is where the fire happens. As air exits the compressor and enters the combustor, it is mixed with fuel, and ignited.
It sounds simple, but it’s actually a very complex process. That’s because the combustor needs to maintain a stable combustion of fuel&#x2F;air mixture, while the air is moving through the combustor at an extremely fast rate.
This is the same shaft that the fan and compressor are connected to, so by spinning the turbine, the fan and compressor on the front of the engine continue sucking in more air that will soon be mixed with fuel and burned.
The NozzleThe last step of the process happens in the nozzle. The nozzle is essentially the exhaust duct of the engine, and it’s where the high-speed air shoots out the back.
This is also the part where Sir Isaac Newton’s third law comes into play: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Put simply, by forcing air out the back of the engine at high-speed, the airplane is pushed forward.
In some engines, there’s a mixer in the exhaust nozzle as well. This simply mixes some of the bypass air flowing around the engine with the hot, combusted air, making the engine quieter.

To start an engine on the Boeing 737, a number of tasks in a checklist has to be followed.


The ones directly concerning engine operation are:

Aircraft’s Electrical Power has to be established for operation of two computers that plays a vital role in a successful engine start,
Electronic Engine Control located on the right side of the engines,
and Display Electronics Unit located in aircraft’s electronic compartment.



Fuel Pumps of the aircraft have to be turned on, this transfers low pressure fuel from the fuel tanks to the engine’s bar valve. In order to crank the engine, pneumatic power is required. Three sources of pneumatic power can be used by connecting an external jet starter unit. From the other engine if it’s running, or from the APU which is the standard practice.Ignition switch position has to be changed. For redundancy each engine has two ignition system, left and right, standard procedure requires to change the switch position before each start.


Now that the engine is configured for start. Turn the engine start switch to ground start position, a solenoid controlled by display electronics unit latches and holds the switch. The start switch now sends an electrical signal to the start valve on the engine fan case to open, the pneumatic power reaches the starter.The starter which is an air-driven motor, consisting of turbine reduction gears, and clutch turns the output shaft of the accessory gearbox on the engine. The output shaft of the gearbox turns the N2 rotor of the engine on which are mounted high pressure compressors and high pressure turbine.N2 rotation induces air suction into the engine. As a result, the N1 rotor of the engine on which the fan low pressure compressors and low pressure turbines are mounted begins to rotate marginally.Speed sensors send the rotation speed of the N2 and N1 rotors to DEU,  which displays them in the cockpit, the N2 reaches 25% of its maximum rpm, the engine has now reached the maximum motoring stage.


Now move the start lever from cut off to idle position. The start lever causes engine fuel spar valve to open, and fuel reaches the engine shutoff valve. The start lever also sends an electrical signal to the electronic engine control.The EEC commands the engine shutoff valve to open transferring fuel to the engine fuel pump mounted on the accessory gearbox. The fuel pump increases the fuel pressure and transfers it to the fuel metering valve.EEC now controls the rate of fuel flow by controlling the fuel metering valve, which transfers the fuel into the combustion chamber through the fuel nozzles. At the same time, EEC commands the ignition exciter box to ignite the fuel air mixture in the combustion chamber with the help of igniter plug.The combustion increases high pressure and low pressure turbines rotation , this shoots up the N1 and N2 rotors rpm. Thermocouple sensors send the exhaust gas temperature data to the EEC.


EEC monitors engine parameters and if it notices any anomaly immediately cuts off the fuel supply and ignition. At 56% N2, the engine reaches a self-sustainable level. The DEU removes the ground from start switch solenoid and the switch goes to off position, this removes the power to the start valve, which closes to stop the pneumatic supply to starter.The reduction in pressure reduces starter speed, which disengages the clutch isolating the starter from the engine gearbox rotation. As the temperature inside combustion chamber is enough for continuous fuel air mixture ignition, EEC deactivates the ignition system. Now the engine has reached the idle stage.


In order to increase the engine thrust to high power, move the thrust lever ahead, resolver sends an output voltage proportional to the thrust lever angle to the EEC.The EEC according to the position increases the fuel flow rate through the fuel metering valve. By supplying more fuel for combustion, the EEC increases the thrust of the engine to maximum power.


To shut down the engine, move the thrust lever back to idle. This will decrease fuel flow for combustion and the engine will go back to the idle speed, then move the start lever to cut off, this will stop the fuel flow and the engine will gradually come to an halt.

航空发动机主要分成两种，一种是涡喷发动机，另一种是涡扇发动机。
涡喷发动机有心式和轴流式两种布局。如今的涡喷发动机大多都是轴流式，在发动机内部拥有一个转轴。当气流通过发动机时，就能产生向后的推力。而涡扇发动机就是在涡喷发动机的前面安装一个风扇，然后在风扇外侧加装一个外涵道。
在发动机前安装一个风扇，就能自主调节通过气流，变循环发动机应运而生。变循环发动机是涡扇发动机的一种，运用了传感器技术和数字电子控制技术。它拥有三个空气流道。除了转轴和外涵道这两个常规空气流道之外，还拥有一个额外的空气流道。它能够根据当前情况调整航道比和风扇承受的压力，以此提升燃油效率和提升发动机推力。而变循环指的是发动机能够自主调节内部的热力循环系统。变循环发动机，不仅能降低溢流和后方阻力，还能减少飞机的燃油消耗。
一般发动机的热力循环分为四个环节：压缩、加热、膨胀和放热。这也是理想状态下发动机的热力循环方式。其实涡喷发动机的工作原理非常简单，可飞机所处位置越高，空气温度也就越低。因此所有流过发动机的空气都需要用燃料加热才能投入循环。这也是涡喷发动机性价比低的原因。
涡喷发动机在低空状态下每时每刻都在浪费能源。为了解决涡喷发动机的这些缺点，研究人员特地在涡喷发动机前安装一个风扇。其实涡扇发动机和其他发动机的热力循环原理是一样的，但是涡扇发动机有一点不同，它多了一个风扇和外涵道涡轮。当风扇启动后，就能消耗一部分发动机燃气动能，从而降低燃气排放速度，降低飞机在低空环境下的燃油消耗。当处于高空环境时，风扇也会吸入一部分空气送进内涵道中，为飞机提供更强的推力。涡扇发动机的燃气能量会分配到风扇和燃料室中，产生两种排气气流，让飞机的热效率和推进效率达到平衡，从而提升发动机的性价比。性价比高也就意味着油耗低、巡航时间长，增加飞机的航程范围。总而言之，涡扇发动机不仅能够产生更强的推力，还能减少在巡航状态下的燃料消耗。除此之外，涡扇发动机运行时产生的声音要远远小于其他发动机。不过涡扇发动机也有自己的缺点，那就是风扇面积过大，会增加飞机的迎风面，并且结构十分复杂，制造难度太大。
