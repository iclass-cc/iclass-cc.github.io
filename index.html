<p>A flight deck implies a bigger space with room to move or walk around. As opposed to a <strong>cockpit</strong>, with just enough space for seats that pilots might climb into. Starting at the back wall of the flight deck, there are hat clips and the pilot’s wardrobe closet. On the other side there’s a jump seat that slides and folds out, there’s a crash axe nearby, as well as a flashlight oxygen cylinder and portable breathing equipment. Detailed circuit breaker panels are situated near the back wall on both sides.</p>
<img src="/2022/12/25/2022-12-24-20-19-a-350/seat.png" width="444" align="right">

<p>Cockpit includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrument panels:<ul>
<li>Overhead panel</li>
<li>Main instrument panel</li>
<li>Glareshield</li>
<li>Pedestal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The captain and first officer lateral consoles that each have:<ul>
<li>One sidestick</li>
<li>One steering handwheel</li>
<li>One oxygen mask</li>
<li>One stowed laptop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Seating"><a href="#Seating" class="headerlink" title="Seating"></a>Seating</h3><p>The pilot and co-pilot seats move back into the side for entry. They have a five point harness and ample adjustments for proper access to flight controls as well as comfort. There are heated foot mats in the floor. Eye level locators between the front windshields indicate proper seat position, ensuring optimal visibility for all flight deck operations.</p>
<img src="/2022/12/25/2022-12-24-20-19-a-350/layout.png" width="333" align="right">

<p>The ideal position is reached when the white sphere is completely hidden behind the front red sphere as viewed by the person adjusting the seat the armrest on the outside of each seat has tilt and vertical adjustment knobs for unobstructed arm mobility when using the side stick or tiller there’s a small step near the inside shoulder of each seat back for access to an overhead escape hatch. A compartment holds an emergency rope that flight deck crew can use to slide down the side of the plane.</p>
<h3 id="Side-Stick"><a href="#Side-Stick" class="headerlink" title="Side Stick"></a>Side Stick</h3><img src="/2022/12/25/2022-12-24-20-19-a-350/stick.png" width="222" align="right">

<p>A side stick controller on each side gives the pilot or co-pilot control over the roll and pitch of the aircraft an autopilot priority switch disconnects autopilot if it’s engaged with autopilot off holding the button gives this side stick priority a pitch trim switch can set the auto trim rate for the horizontal stabilizer or allow manual trim adjustment in direct mode. There’s a switch at the front of the stick for radio or intercom communication.</p>
<h3 id="Steering"><a href="#Steering" class="headerlink" title="Steering"></a>Steering</h3><p>While taxiing under 30 knots, a steering tiller can be used to turn the nose landing gear up to 80 degrees in either direction. In order to avoid damage to the nose landing gear, rotation is limited from 80 degrees down to 9 degrees max as speed increases from 30 to 100 knots and above.</p>
<p>Rudder pedals can be used at any time to rotate the nose landing gear but are limited to the maximum 9 degrees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past the flight bag at each seating position held airplane specific operation manuals navigation charts checklists and so on. Electronic tablet devices have replaced most of these items in recent years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some airplanes may also have a <strong>head-up display</strong> allowing the pilot or co-pilot to view relevant real-time information like runway alignment airspeed altitude and more.</p>

<h3 id="Rudder-Pedals"><a href="#Rudder-Pedals" class="headerlink" title="Rudder Pedals"></a>Rudder Pedals</h3><p>With feet in the lower position rudder pedals move forward and back for rudder control. Moving feet to the upper position allows pedals to rotate engaging left and right main landing gear breaks.</p>
<p>A mechanical linkage ensures the pedals on both sides move together. Pilots can adjust the pedal position with a knob at the front.</p>
<h3 id="Control-Panels"><a href="#Control-Panels" class="headerlink" title="Control Panels"></a>Control Panels</h3><p><img src="/2022/12/25/2022-12-24-20-19-a-350/overhead.png"></p>
<p>Control panels starting with the overhead panel. Many of the switches in these panels have lights that convey important info something like the warning lights in a car’s dashboard. However unlike simple car warning lights when pilots interact with these switches their lighting status can update.</p>
<p>A fire module sits in the center the switches glow red when a fire is detected some of these switches are protected with doors that must be flipped open for access pressing a fire switch helps mitigate fire spread and damage by shutting off fuel to the respective engine and arming fire extinguisher bottles among other things once armed nearby switches discharge specific fire extinguishing bottles when pressed.</p>
<img src="/2022/12/25/2022-12-24-20-19-a-350/fire.png" width="222" align="left">

<p>The outboard module starting at the back the entrance knob and dome switch control flight deck lighting the protected aural warn switch allows the audible warning system to be silenced if there’s an issue with the oral system. This system handles the many warning sounds and phrases that alert pilots to critical events. Window heat and probe heat toggle the icing functionality for windows and external temperature measuring devices or probes primary flight control computers can be individually disabled using any of these three protected switches.</p>
<p>The <strong>CVR section</strong> handles the cockpit voice recorder which records not only sounds inside the flight deck but also all connected audio channels both internal and external.</p>
<p>The next panel section has knobs to control lighting brightness for circuit breaker panels. Overhead panels the compass and more turning this knob to the storm setting illuminates the complete flight deck all panels and dome lights to maximum intensity.</p>
<p>The next panel controls communication during plane servicing with the service intercom switch on all flight deck and service intercom channels are opened the call button sounds a horn in the external service panel area at the end of this module there are captain’s side reading light and windshield wiper controls.</p>

<p>The <strong>HYDraulic section</strong> has controls for various hydraulic system scenarios since there are three separate hydraulic systems in the plane for safety and redundancy this panel allows various configurations so these systems can work as normal or supplement each other in varying conditions the electrical section has a knob for various electrical system scenarios for example the ess setting powers only essential systems the guarded switch next to this knob turns off power to select cabin systems which can be useful for isolating sources of smoke in the cabin whether from electrical arcing or some other source the guarded rat switch allows flight crew to manually deploy the ram air turbine or rat under normal conditions the rat will deploy automatically if power is lost in flight.</p>
<p>Battery knobs control on board battery packs one and two the left and right gen switches toggle engine driven electrical power generators, each has a protected disconnect switch to disconnect the generator shaft from the engine. If for example leaving a malfunctioning generator connected could lead to engine damage. </p>
<p>The APU switch can disconnect the auxiliary power unit from the system in case of an electrical fault the ext switch allows crew to toggle the external power connection. The APU pull turn switch functions something like a car ignition the start setting is held for 3 seconds to start the APU once started the switch reverts to the run position the APU fail light illuminates for any electrical fire or starting issues the terrain awareness and warning system has protected switches to turn off aural warnings associated with landing gear terrain detection and flaps.</p>
<p>The GS switch turns off oral warnings related to glide slope which is the pre-calculated path of descent in the flight control system.</p>
<img src="/2022/12/25/2022-12-24-20-19-a-350/fuel.png" width="333" align="left">

<p>The <strong>Fuel subsection</strong> with the manual transfer switch in off mode the fuel system functions as normal the other settings allow flight crew to select specific fuel tank configurations. Left and right boost pump switches control supplemental electrically powered fuel pumps,where the system under normal operation relies on engine driven pumps as the primary source of fuel pressure. The gravity transfer switch opens valves so that the fuel can move between tanks by gravity alone the air section has climate controls at the top and also ventilation settings for cargo compartments.</p>
<p>The trim air switch toggles valves that allow air from the engine bleed air system into the climate control system when the pac flow switch is active the air conditioning units or packs enter high flow mode which can be useful for clearing smoke or odors there’s a switch for recirculating air fans the guarded ram air switch can open external ports at low altitude for flight deck or cabin ventilation left and right pack switches grant manual control over air conditioning packs which otherwise operate automatically based on desired climate control settings cross bleed left and right bleed switches grant manual control for engine bleed air valves and APU bleed air the anti-ice section controls de-icing capabilities in the left and right engine cowling and wings right overhead module the elt or emergency locator transmitter pull turn knob can test and arm the elt the cargo section handles fire reporting and deploying fire extinguishing bottles in the cargo areas.</p>
<p>Equipment cooling refers to cooling systems for equipment bays the inlet switch controls cooling fans and an external valve to take in outside air there’s also a switch for exhaust air produced by the equipment cooling system in the pressurization section there’s a guarded switch for emergency depressurization of passenger and flight crew areas the auto press switch allows manual pressurization control which is usually an automated process in manual mode the dial beneath sets the pressurization rate the guarded ditching switch activates a ditching sequence ditching is a controlled emergency water landing in an aircraft not designed for such the ditching sequence closes all valves below the aircraft flotation line.</p>
<p>Except for the ram air valve, the PAX oxy switch deploys passenger oxygen masks at the end of this section there’s a switch to toggle the evacuation horn and a pull turn switch for evacuation lighting beyond that we see the co-pilot side windshield wiper and reading light switches.</p>

          Judo (Japanese: 柔道, Hepburn: Jūdō, lit. ‘gentle way’) is an unarmed modern Japanese martial art, Olympic sport (since 1964), and the most prominent form of jacket wrestling competed internationally. Judo was created in 1882 by Kanō Jigorō (嘉納 治五郎) as an eclectic martial art, distinguishing itself from its predecessors (primarily Tenjin Shinyo-ryu jujutsu and Kitō-ryū jujutsu) due to an emphasis on “randori” (乱取り, lit. ‘free sparring’) instead of “kata” (pre-arranged forms) alongside its removal of striking and weapon training elements.

          Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain that is a worldwide staple food. The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat. The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis.

          Finance affects every business function. It’s what determines the number of employees you can hire, and dictates your annual budget. It’s what helps you balance short-term expenses with long-term goals, and meaningfully measure your team’s performance. Quite frankly, it’s what keeps your company afloat; an organization can’t operate successfully if it’s not financially sound.

          In Texas hold ‘em, as in all variants of poker, individuals compete for an amount of money or chips contributed by the players themselves (called the pot). Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand they are holding, and on their prediction as to what their opponents may be holding and how they might behave.

          Chloë Grace Moretz began acting as a child. Her breakthrough came in 2010 with her critically acclaimed performances as Hit-Girl in the superhero film Kick-Ass and as a child vampire in the horror film Let Me In.
She was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Cartersville, Georgia. Her mother, Teri Duke, is a nurse practitioner, and her father, Dr. McCoy “Mac” Moretz (1957–2021), was a plastic surgeon, and heir to the Moretz hosiery business, bought out in 2011 for $350 million. She has four older brothers: Brandon, Trevor, Colin, and Ethan; an older sister, Kathleen, died shortly after birth. She has described her family as “very Christian”, specifically Southern Baptist. She moved to New York City in 2002, with her mother and brother Trevor, because he had been accepted into the Professional Performing Arts School, which is what first drew her interest in acting. Moretz would help Trevor read lines.
