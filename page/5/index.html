The Dào that can be told of is not an Unvarying Way; The names that can be named are not unvarying names. It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang; The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures, each after its kind. Truly, ‘Only he that rids himself forever of desire can see the Secret Essences’; He that has never rid himself of desire can see only the Outcomes. These two things issued from the same mould, but nevertheless are different in name. This ‘same mould’ we can but call the Mystery, Or rather the ‘Darker than any Mystery’, The Doorway whence issued all Secret Essences.


It is because every one under Heaven recognizes beauty as beauty, that the idea of ugliness exists. And equally if every one recognized virtue as virtue, this would merely create fresh conceptions of wickedness. For truly ‘Being and Not-being grow out of one another; Difficult and easy complete one another. Long and short test one another; High and low determine one another. Pitch and mode give harmony to one another. Front and back give sequence to one another’. Therefore the Sage relies on actionless activity, Carries on wordless teaching, But the myriad creatures are worked upon by him; he does not disown them. He rears them, but does not lay claim to them, Controls them, but does not lean upon them, Achieves his aim, but does not call attention to what he does; And for the very reason that he does not call attention to what he does He is not ejected from fruition of what he has done.

<p>A <strong>logic gate</strong> is an idealized model of computation or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output. Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has for instance zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device (see Ideal and real op-amps for comparison).</p>
<p>Logic gates are primarily implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches, but can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays (relay logic), fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements. With amplification, logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic.</p>
<p>Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates. In modern practice, most gates are made from MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors).</p>
<p>Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert (AOI) and OR-AND-Invert (OAI) are often employed in circuit design because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates.</p>

<p>Microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.</p>
<p>A consensus view has evolved over time in the industry. Some of the defining characteristics that are frequently cited include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services in a microservice architecture (MSA) are often processes that communicate over a network to fulfil a goal using technology-agnostic protocols such as HTTP.</li>
<li>Services are organized around business capabilities.</li>
<li>Services can be implemented using different programming languages, databases, hardware and software environment, depending on what fits best.</li>
<li>Services are small in size, messaging-enabled, bounded by contexts, autonomously developed, independently deployable, decentralized and built and released with automated processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>A microservice is not a layer within a monolithic application (example, the web controller, or the backend-for-frontend).<br>Rather it is a self-contained piece of business functionality with clear interfaces, and may, through its own internal components, implement a layered architecture. From a strategy perspective, microservices architecture essentially follows the Unix philosophy of “Do one thing and do it well”.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> describes a microservices-based architecture as having the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lends itself to a continuous delivery software development process. A change to a small part of the application only requires rebuilding and redeploying only one or a small number of services.</li>
<li>Adheres to principles such as fine-grained interfaces (to independently deployable services), business-driven development (e.g. domain-driven design).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common for microservices architectures to be adopted for cloud-native applications,<br>serverless computing, and applications using lightweight container deployment.<br>According to Fowler, because of the large number (when compared to monolithic application implementations) of services,<br>decentralized continuous delivery and DevOps with holistic service monitoring are necessary to effectively develop, maintain, and operate such applications.</p>
<p>A consequence of (and rationale for) following this approach is that the individual microservices can be individually scaled.<br>In the monolithic approach, an application supporting three functions would have to be scaled in its entirety even if only one of these functions had a resource constraint.<br>With microservices, only the microservice supporting the function with resource constraints needs to be scaled out, thus providing resource and cost optimization benefits.</p>

        <p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor,<br>main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input&#x2F;output (I&#x2F;O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I&#x2F;O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>
<p><img src="/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-13-29-cpu/cpulogic.png"></p>
<p>The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged.<br>Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A GPU has more arithmetic logic units than a typical CPU.<br>It increased ability to process simple operations in parallel.</p>

          A gas station, also known as a filling station, fueling station, service station or petrol station is a facility which sells fuel and lubricants for motor vehicles. The most common fuels sold are gasoline (petrol) or diesel fuel.
Many gas stations have a convenience store close to the pumps, to make extra earnings.
Some have tunnel car washs.
加油站，也称为加油站，加油站，加油站或加油站，是出售机动车辆燃料和润滑剂的设施。
出售的最常见的燃料是汽油（汽油）或柴油。
许多加油站都在靠近泵的地方设有便利店，以增加收入。有些设有自动通道洗车场。

          1948$$H(S) \leqslant m(S) \leqslant H(S) + 1$$
The mathematician Claude Shannon introduced the entropy in information theory in 1948. Entropy in information theory can be defined as the expected number of bits of information contained in an event. For instance, tossing a fair coin has the entropy of 1. It is because of the probability of having a head or tail is 0.5. The amount of information required to identify it’s head or tail is one by asking one, yes or no question — “is it head ? or is it tail?”. If the entropy is higher, that means we need more information to represent an event. Now, we can say that entropy increases with increases in uncertainty. Another example is that crossing the street has less number of information required to represent &#x2F; store &#x2F; communicate than playing a poker game.
Calculating how much information is in a random variable, $X&#x3D;{x_{0}, x_{1}, …. , x_{n}}$ is same as calculating the information for the probability distribution of the events in the random variable. In that sense, entropy is considered as average bits of information required to represent an event drawn from the probability distribution. Entropy for a random variable X can be computed using the below equation:
$${ Entropy, } \ H(X)&#x3D;-\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n} P\left(x_{i}\right) \log {2}\left(P\left(x{i}\right)\right)$$
1971$$P \stackrel{?}{&#x3D;} N P$$
In 1971, Stephen Cook introduced the precise statement of the P versus NP problem in his article “The complexity of theorem proving procedures”. Today, many people consider this problem to be the most important open problem in computer science.
1976$$x_{n+1}&#x3D;r x_{n}\left(1-x_{n}\right)$$
 The logistic map – also known as the “logistic difference equation” – was made famous by Robert May in 1976 when he used it to model the behaviour of each generation of a biological species, and found to his amazement that from this simplest of mathematical models, complex dynamics can emerge.
The logistic map is a discrete recursive mathematical function that maps the output of one iteration of the function onto the input of the next.  Thus the logistic map is a simple mathematical way of examining the effects of feedback on population growth.
1994$$\begin{array}{c}x^{n}+y^{n}&#x3D;z^{n} \quad n&gt;2 \&#x3D;&gt; \x y z&#x3D;0\end{array}$$
In 1994, Andrew Wiles, 62, cracked Fermat’s Last Theorem, which was put forth by 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat.
In number theory, Fermat’s Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat’s conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers x, y, and z satisfy the equation $x^{n} + y^{n} &#x3D; z^{n}$ for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n &#x3D; 1 and n &#x3D; 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions.
The proposition was first stated as a theorem by Pierre de Fermat around 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica; Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. Although other statements claimed by Fermat without proof were subsequently proven by others and credited as theorems of Fermat (for instance, Fermat’s theorem on sums of two squares), Fermat’s Last Theorem resisted proof, leading to doubt that Fermat ever had a correct proof and it becoming known as a conjecture rather than a theorem. After 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995; it was described as a “stunning advance” in the citation for Wiles’s Abel Prize award in 2016. It also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques.

Lyapunov’s theorem in probability theory is a theorem that establishes very general sufficient conditions for the convergence of the distributions of sums of independent random variables to the normal distribution.
 Lyapunov functions (also called the Lyapunov’s second method for stability) are important to stability theory of dynamical systems and control theory. A similar concept appears in the theory of general state space Markov chains, usually under the name Foster–Lyapunov functions.
1904$$l^{‘}&#x3D;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} &#x2F; c^{2}}}$$
The so-called Lorentz transformation (1904) was based on the fact that electromagnetic forces between charges are subject to slight alterations due to their motion, resulting in a minute contraction in the size of moving bodies. It not only adequately explains the apparent absence of the relative motion of the Earth with respect to the ether, as indicated by the experiments of Michelson and Morley, but also paved the way for Einstein’s special theory of relativity.
It may well be said that Lorentz was regarded by all theoretical physicists as the world’s leading spirit, who completed what was left unfinished by his predecessors and prepared the ground for the fruitful reception of the new ideas based on the quantum theory.
1914$$\frac{1}{\pi}&#x3D;\frac{\sqrt{8}}{99^{2}} \sum_{n&#x3D;0}^{\infty} \frac{(4 n) !}{(n !)^{4}} \frac{(1103+26390 n)}{396^{4 n}}$$
In 1914, Ramanujan found a formula for computing π (pi) that is currently the basis for the fastest algorithms used to calculate π. The circle method, which he developed with G. H. Hardy, constitute a large area of current mathematical research. Moreover, Ramanujan discovered K3 surfaces which play key roles today in string theory and quantum physics; while his mock modular forms are being used in an effort to unlock the secret of black holes. Know more about the achievements of Srinivasa Ramanujan through his 10 major contributions to mathematics.
1926$$i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}&#x3D;\frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \nabla^{2} \psi+V \psi$$
In physics, specifically quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, formulated in 1926 by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, is an equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes in time. It is as central to quantum mechanics as Newton’s laws are to classical mechanics.
1927$$\Delta_{\psi}(P) \Delta_{\psi}(X) \geq \hbar$$
In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle, such as position, x, and momentum, p, can be predicted from initial conditions.
1927$$\begin{array}{c}\frac{d S}{d t}&#x3D;-r S L \\frac{d I}{d t}&#x3D;r S L-b I \\frac{d R}{d t}&#x3D;b I\end{array}$$
The SIR is a Compartmental model where the population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. The origin of compartmental models trace back to the early 20th century, with an important early work being that of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.

 Cauchy’s integral formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a central statement in complex analysis. It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk, and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy’s formula shows that, in complex analysis, “differentiation is equivalent to integration”: complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits – a result that does not hold in real analysis.

In mathematics, non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on axioms closely related to those that specify Euclidean geometry. As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-Euclidean geometry arises by either relaxing the metric requirement, or replacing the parallel postulate with an alternative.
Between 1820 and 1823, János Bolyai, a Hungarian mathematician, prepared, but did not immediately publish, a treatise on a complete system of non-Euclidean geometry.
Completely independent from Bolyai, in the distant provincial Russian city of Kazan, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky had also been working, along very similar lines as Bolyai, to develop a geometry in which Euclid’s fifth postulate did not apply. His work on hyperbolic geometry was first reported in 1826 and published in 1830, although it did not have general circulation until some time later.
This early non-Euclidean geometry is now often referred to as Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, thus sharing the credit.

1838$$\frac{d N}{d t}&#x3D;r N\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)$$
Pierre François Verhulst developed the logistic function in a series of three papers between 1838 and 1847, based on research on modeling population growth that he conducted in the mid 1830s, under the guidance of Adolphe Quetelet.
The concept of R&#x2F;K selection theory derives its name from the competing dynamics of exponential growth and carrying capacity.
1822 1842$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u \cdot \nabla u&#x3D;-\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p+v \nabla^{2} u+g$$
In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations (&#x2F;nævˈjeɪ stoʊks&#x2F;) are a set of partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.
The equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing.
1848$$\iint_{S} K d A&#x3D;2 \pi \chi(S)$$
The Gauss–Bonnet formula, is a relationship between surfaces in differential geometry. It connects the curvature of a surface (from geometry) to its Euler characteristic (from topology).
In the simplest application, the case of a triangle on a plane, the sum of its angles is 180 degrees. The Gauss–Bonnet formula extends this to more complicated shapes and curved surfaces, connecting the local and global geometries.
The theorem is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who developed a version but never published it, and Pierre Ossian Bonnet, who published a special case in 1848.
1864$$\begin{array}{cc}\nabla \cdot E&#x3D;0 &amp; \nabla \cdot B&#x3D;0 \\nabla \times E&#x3D;-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} &amp; \nabla \times B&#x3D;\frac{1}{c^{2}} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}\end{array}$$
Maxwell’s equations are a set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits. The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, wireless communication, lenses, radar etc.
1870$$l^{2} \geq 4 \pi A$$
The isoperimetric inequality is a geometric inequality involving the perimeter of a set and its volume.
It relates the square of the circumference of a closed curve and the area of a plane region it encloses.
1884$$P&#x3D;\sum_{k} \exp \left(-\frac{E_{k}}{k_{B} T}\right)$$
In statistical mechanics, a canonical ensemble is the statistical ensemble that represents the possible states of a mechanical system in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at a fixed temperature. The system can exchange energy with the heat bath, so that the states of the system will differ in total energy. 
The principal thermodynamic variable of the canonical ensemble, determining the probability distribution of states, is the absolute temperature (symbol: T). The ensemble typically also depends on mechanical variables such as the number of particles in the system (symbol: N) and the system’s volume (symbol: V), each of which influence the nature of the system’s internal states. An ensemble with these three parameters is sometimes called the NVT ensemble.
1896$$\pi(n) \sim \frac{n}{\log n}$$
In number theory, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs. The theorem was proved independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin in 1896 using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann (in particular, the Riemann zeta function).
The first such distribution found is π(N) ~ N &#x2F; log(N), where π(N) is the prime-counting function (the number of primes less than or equal to N) and log(N) is the natural logarithm of N. This means that for large enough N, the probability that a random integer not greater than N is prime is very close to 1 &#x2F; log(N). Consequently, a random integer with at most 2n digits (for large enough n) is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (log(101000) ≈ 2302.6), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (log(102000) ≈ 4605.2). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first N integers is roughly log(N).

At some point in the early 1500’s, an Italian mathematician named Scipione del Ferro determined a general solution for what is known as the depressed cubic equation.  This is cubic equation without any $x^{2}$ terms.  The general form is : $x^{3} + mx &#x3D; n$ .  As it turns out, any cubic equation of the form $x^{3} + bx^{2} + cx + d &#x3D; 0$ can be written as a depressed cubic, but that came later.
At the time, mathematicians didn’t publish their results, but, instead, kept them secret so that they could win the problem contests that were common at the time in Italy.  As a result, del Ferro didn’t tell anyone about his discovery until shortly before his death in 1526.  He then revealed the secret to a student of his named Antonio Maria Fior.  In 1535, Fior used this knowledge to challenge a better mathematicain named Niccolo Fontana to a problem contest.
1636$$a^{p} \equiv a \quad \bmod p$$
Fermat’s little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a − a is an integer multiple of p. In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as aᵖ≡a mod p. For example, if a &#x3D; 2 and p &#x3D; 7, then 2⁷ &#x3D; 128, and 128 − 2 &#x3D; 126 &#x3D; 7 × 18 is an integer multiple of 7. If a is not divisible by p, Fermat’s little theorem is equivalent to the statement that a − 1 is an integer multiple of p, or in symbols: aᵖ⁻¹≡1 mod p.
For example, if a &#x3D; 2 and p &#x3D; 7, then 26 &#x3D; 64, and 64 − 1 &#x3D; 63 &#x3D; 7 × 9 is thus a multiple of 7.
Fermat’s little theorem is the basis for the Fermat primality test and is one of the fundamental results of elementary number theory. The theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat, who stated it in 1640. It is called the “little theorem” to distinguish it from Fermat’s last theorem.
1637$$\begin{array}{c}x^{n}+y^{n}&#x3D;z^{n} \quad n&gt;2 \&#x3D;&gt; \x y z&#x3D;0\end{array}$$
In number theory, Fermat’s Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat’s conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers x, y, and z satisfy the equation $x^{n} + y^{n} &#x3D; z^{n}$ for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n &#x3D; 1 and n &#x3D; 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions.
1674$$\frac{\pi}{4}&#x3D;1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\cdots$$
In mathematics, the Leibniz formula for ${\pi}$, named after Gottfried Leibniz. It is also called the Madhava–Leibniz series as it is a special case of a more general series expansion for the inverse tangent function, first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in the 14th century, the specific case first published by Leibniz around 1674. The series for the inverse tangent function, which is also known as Gregory’s series, can be given by:
$$\arctan x&#x3D;x-\frac{x^{3}}{3}+\frac{x^{5}}{5}-\frac{x^{7}}{7}+\cdots$$
The Leibniz formula for $\frac{\pi}{4}$ can be obtained by putting x &#x3D; 1 into this series.
It also is the Dirichlet L-series of the non-principal Dirichlet character of modulus 4 evaluated at s &#x3D; 1, and therefore the value β(1) of the Dirichlet beta function.
1735$$\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}&#x3D;1+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots$$
The Basel problem is a problem in mathematical analysis with relevance to number theory, first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1650 and solved by Leonhard Euler in 1734, and read on 5 December 1735 in The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Since the problem had withstood the attacks of the leading mathematicians of the day, Euler’s solution brought him immediate fame when he was twenty-eight. Euler generalised the problem considerably, and his ideas were taken up years later by Bernhard Riemann in his seminal 1859 paper “On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude”, in which he defined his zeta function and proved its basic properties. The problem is named after Basel, hometown of Euler as well as of the Bernoulli family who unsuccessfully attacked the problem.
The Basel problem asks for the precise summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers, i.e. the precise sum of the infinite series:
$$\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2}}&#x3D;\frac{1}{1^{2}}+\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\frac{1}{3^{2}}+\cdots$$
The sum of the series is approximately equal to 1.644934. The Basel problem asks for the exact sum of this series (in closed form), as well as a proof that this sum is correct. Euler found the exact sum to be $\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$ and announced this discovery in 1735. His arguments were based on manipulations that were not justified at the time, although he was later proven correct. He produced a truly rigorous proof in 1741.
1737$$\sum_{p_{n}} \frac{1}{p_{n}}$$
Euler achieved the first major advance beyond Euclid’s proof by combining his method of generating functions with another highlight of ancient Greek number theory, unique factorization into primes.
Theorem [Euler product for the zeta function]. The identity
$$\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}}&#x3D;\prod_{p \text { prime }} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$
holds for all s such that the left-hand side converges absolutely.
Proof : Here and henceforth we adopt the convention:The notation $\prod_{p}$ or $\sum_{p}$ means a product or sum over prime p.
1746$$\frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial t^{2}}&#x3D;c^{2} \frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}}$$
The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of waves—as they occur in classical physics—such as mechanical waves (e.g. water waves, sound waves and seismic waves) or light waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics.
Historically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d’Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. In 1746, d’Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.
1750$$V-E+F&#x3D;2$$
Euler formula: for any convex polyhedron, the number of vertices and faces together is exactly two more than the number of edges. Symbolically V−E+F&#x3D;2. For instance, a tetrahedron has four vertices, four faces, and six edges; 4-6+4&#x3D;2.
A version of the formula dates over 100 years earlier than Euler, to Descartes in 1630. Descartes gives a discrete form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, stating that the sum of the face angles of a polyhedron is 2π(V−2), from which he infers that the number of plane angles is 2F+2V-4. The number of plane angles is always twice the number of edges, so this is equivalent to Euler’s formula, but later authors such as Lakatos, Malkevitch, and Polya disagree, feeling that the distinction between face angles and edges is too large for this to be viewed as the same formula. The formula V−E+F&#x3D;2 was (re)discovered by Euler; he wrote about it twice in 1750, and in 1752 published the result, with a faulty proof by induction for triangulated polyhedra based on removing a vertex and retriangulating the hole formed by its removal. The retriangulation step does not necessarily preserve the convexity or planarity of the resulting shape, so the induction does not go through. Another early attempt at a proof, by Meister in 1784, is essentially the triangle removal proof given here, but without justifying the existence of a triangle to remove. In 1794, Legendre provided a complete proof, using spherical angles. Cauchy got into the act in 1811, citing Legendre and adding incomplete proofs based on triangle removal, ear decomposition, and tetrahedron removal from a tetrahedralization of a partition of the polyhedron into smaller polyhedra. Hilton and Pederson provide more references as well as entertaining speculation on Euler’s discovery of the formula.
1760For a non-conservative force which depends on velocity, it may be possible to find a potential energy function V that depends on positions and velocities. If the generalized forces $Q_{i}$ can be derived from a potential V such that
$$Q_{i}&#x3D;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \dot{q}{i}}-\frac{\partial V}{\partial q{i}}$$
equating to Lagrange’s equations and defining the Lagrangian as L &#x3D; T − V obtains Lagrange’s equations of the second kind or the Euler–Lagrange equations of motion
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}-\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_{i}}&#x3D;0$$
However, the Euler–Lagrange equations can only account for non-conservative forces if a potential can be found as shown. This may not always be possible for non-conservative forces, and Lagrange’s equations do not involve any potential, only generalized forces; therefore they are more general than the Euler–Lagrange equations.
The Euler–Lagrange equations also follow from the calculus of variations. The variation of the Lagrangian is
$$\delta L&#x3D;\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}} \delta q_{i}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}{i}} \delta \dot{q}{i}\right) , \quad \delta \dot{q}{i} \equiv \delta \frac{\mathrm{d} q{i}}{\mathrm{~d} t} \equiv \frac{\mathrm{d}\left(\delta q_{i}\right)}{\mathrm{d} t} \ ,$$
which has a form similar to the total differential of L, but the virtual displacements and their time derivatives replace differentials, and there is no time increment in accordance with the definition of the virtual displacements. An integration by parts with respect to time can transfer the time derivative of $\delta q_{i}$ to the $\partial L &#x2F; \partial(\mathrm{d} q_{i} &#x2F; \mathrm{d} t)$, in the process exchanging $\mathrm{d}\left(\delta q_{i}\right) &#x2F; \mathrm{d} t$ for $\delta q_{i}$, allowing the independent virtual displacements to be factorized from the derivatives of the Lagrangian,
$$\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \delta L \mathrm{d} t&#x3D;\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}} \delta q_{i}+\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}{i}} \delta q{i}\right)-\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}{i}} \delta q{i}\right) \mathrm{d} t&#x3D;\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}{i}} \delta q{i}\right]{t{1}}^{t_{2}}+\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}-\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}{i}}\right) \delta q{i} \mathrm{d} t \ .$$
Now, if the condition $\delta q_{i}(t_{1}) &#x3D; \delta q_{i}(t_{2}) &#x3D; 0$ holds for all i, the terms not integrated are zero. If in addition the entire time integral of $\delta L$ is zero, then because the $\delta q_{i}$ are independent, and the only way for a definite integral to be zero is if the integrand equals zero, each of the coefficients of $\delta q_{i}$ must also be zero. Then we obtain the equations of motion. This can be summarized by Hamilton’s principle;
$$\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \delta L \mathrm{~d} t&#x3D;0 \ .$$
The time integral of the Lagrangian is another quantity called the action, defined as
$$S&#x3D;\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} L \mathrm{~d} t \ ,$$
which is a functional; it takes in the Lagrangian function for all times between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ and returns a scalar value. Its dimensions are the same as [angular momentum], [energy]·[time], or [length]·[momentum]. With this definition Hamilton’s principle is
$$\delta S&#x3D;0 \ .$$
Thus, instead of thinking about particles accelerating in response to applied forces, one might think of them picking out the path with a stationary action, with the end points of the path in configuration space held fixed at the initial and final times. Hamilton’s principle is sometimes referred to as the principle of least action, however the action functional need only be stationary, not necessarily a maximum or a minimum value. Any variation of the functional gives an increase in the functional integral of the action.

1799$$\begin{array}{c}\forall p(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x] \\exists z \in \mathbb{C}: p(z)&#x3D;0\end{array}$$
The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with its imaginary part equal to zero.
高斯一生总共对这个定理给出了四个证明，其中第一个是在他22岁时（1799年）的博士论文中给出的。高斯给出的证明既有几何的，也有函数的，还有积分的方法。高斯关于这一命题的证明方法是去证明其根的存在性，开创了关于研究存在性命题的新途径。
