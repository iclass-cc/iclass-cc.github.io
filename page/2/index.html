          In physics and relativity, Time Dilation is the difference in the elapsed time as measured by two clocks. It is either due to a relative velocity between them (“kinetic” time dilation, from special relativity) or to a difference in gravitational potential between their locations (gravitational time dilation, from general relativity). When unspecified, “time dilation” usually refers to the effect due to velocity. After compensating for varying signal delays due to the changing distance between an observer and a moving clock (i.e. Doppler effect), the observer will measure the moving clock as ticking slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer’s own reference frame. In addition, a clock that is close to a massive body (and which therefore is at lower gravitational potential) will record less elapsed time than a clock situated further from the said massive body (and which is at a higher gravitational potential). These predictions of the theory of relativity have been repeatedly confirmed by experiment, and they are of practical concern, for instance in the operation of satellite navigation systems such as GPS and Galileo.

High-accuracy timekeeping, low-Earth-orbit satellite tracking, and pulsar timing are applications that require the consideration of the combined effects of mass and motion in producing time dilation. Practical examples include the International Atomic Time standard and its relationship with the Barycentric Coordinate Time standard used for interplanetary objects.
Relativistic time dilation effects for the solar system and the Earth can be modeled very precisely by the Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations. In the Schwarzschild metric, the interval $d t_{\mathrm{E}}$ is given by:
$$d t_{\mathrm{E}}^{2}&#x3D;\left(1-\frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{i}}}{r_{\mathrm{i}} c^{2}}\right) d t_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}-\left(1-\frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{i}}}{r_{\mathrm{i}} c^{2}}\right)^{-1} \frac{d x^{2}+d y^{2}+d z^{2}}{c^{2}}$$
where:

$d t_{\mathrm{E}}$ is a small increment of proper time $t_{\mathrm{E}}$ (an interval that could be recorded on an atomic clock),$d t_{\mathrm{c}}$ is a small increment in the coordinate $t_{\mathrm{c}}$ (coordinate time),dx, dy, dz are small increments in the three coordinates x, y, z of the clock’s position,$\frac{-G M_{i}}{r_{i}}$ represents the sum of the Newtonian gravitational potentials due to the masses in the neighborhood, based on their distances ${r_{i}}$ from the clock. This sum includes any tidal potentials.

The coordinate velocity of the clock is given by:
$$v^{2}&#x3D;\frac{d x^{2}+d y^{2}+d z^{2}}{d t_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}}$$
The coordinate time $t_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the time that would be read on a hypothetical “coordinate clock” situated infinitely far from all gravitational masses (U&#x3D;0), and stationary in the system of coordinates (v&#x3D;0). The exact relation between the rate of proper time and the rate of coordinate time for a clock with a radial component of velocity is:
$$\frac{d t_{\mathrm{E}}}{d t_{\mathrm{c}}}&#x3D;\sqrt{1+\frac{2 U}{c^{2}}-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}+\left(\frac{c^{2}}{2 U}+1\right)^{-1} \frac{v_{\text {॥ }}^{2}}{c^{2}}}&#x3D;\sqrt{1-\left(\beta^{2}+\beta_{e}^{2}+\frac{\beta_{\text {॥ }}^{2} \beta_{e}^{2}}{1-\beta_{e}^{2}}\right)}$$
where:

$v_{\text {॥ }}^{2}$ is the radial velocity,$v_{e}&#x3D;\sqrt{\frac{2 G M_{i}}{r_{i}}}$ is the escape speed,$\beta&#x3D;v &#x2F; c$, $\beta_{e}&#x3D;v_{e} &#x2F; c$, $\beta_{\text {॥ }}&#x3D;v_{\text {॥ }} &#x2F; c$ are velocities as a percentage of speed of light c,$U&#x3D;\frac{-G M_{i}}{r_{i}}$ is the Newtonian potential; hence -U equals half the square of the escape speed.

The above equation is exact under the assumptions of the Schwarzschild solution. It reduces to velocity time dilation equation in the presence of motion and absence of gravity, i.e. $\beta_{e}&#x3D;0$. It reduces to gravitational time dilation equation in the absence of motion and presence of gravity, i.e. $\beta&#x3D;0&#x3D;\beta_{\text {॥ }}$.

2024, LandingFive starships land on Mars, marking the beginnings of the Mars colony.All of the martian rovers sent by different countries before this day.Watch as the five uncrewed starships land and deliver life support systems,these pioneering starships pave the way for humans to land on Mars in two years time, for fishes to be grown in nine years, and for the first baby to be born on the red planet in 15 years time.
27 April 2025, Location: Erebus MontesThe five starships land at Erebus Montes.The cargo ships are delivering essential life support systems.These are made up of solar panels backup fuel, oxygen, water, dried food,waste management systems, spacesuits, medical supplies and the first habitation pods.There are also tools and equipment for experiments.
One of the starships is carrying Mars’s new starlink communications network, and deploys it in orbit before landing to deliver life-support cargo. Only four satellites are needed to create the martian starlink, as the Mars base will be concentrated to one area. There are also seven football fields worth of solar panels on the cargo list.These are used to power the future base and fuel production solar panels on Mars are only 43% as efficient as they are on earth.
Rovers as well as robotic dogs by Boston Dynamics which SpaceX uses to inspect rockets on earth are deployed from the starships to the martian surface. Work begins on setting up the Mars base, the rovers and robots deploy the solar arrays, prep work begins for fuel production experiments, rovers begin drilling for icy water deposits. The saboteer process is used to take the CO² from the martian atmosphere and hydrogen from mining martian icy water, and then uses heat and pressure to turn it into water oxygen and methane fuel. Multi-use rovers begin flattening and melting the martian regolith the loose soil to prepare a large flat landing pad it reduces the kick-up of dirt and rocks, increasing the safety for the next landings. The population on Mars is made up entirely of robots two years and two months have passed since the first landings of the five cargo starships and the new launch window opens as earth and Mars are close together again.
20 June 2027, Day 1Two starships carrying a total of 30 astronauts land on Mars, 10 additional cargo ships accompany them carrying an oversupply of life support. These first astronaut settlers are scientists, engineers, medical specialists and military personnel with scientific backgrounds. They all have to stay on Mars for the full two years and two months.
This is not a short-term visit. It is a mission to make life sustainable and multi-planetary. During the first week on Mars, the astronauts are suffering from the effects of low gravity after the seven month journey and have weaker muscles. The first week is used to acclimate to the gravity of the red planet and celebrate surviving the journey. The new settlers live in their starships that they landed in the crew begins to adapt to their new surroundings.
Life on Mars is harsh. The average temperature outside is -63°C or -81°F with a maximum of 20°C (68°F) in the summer at the equator. Wind storms are common on Mars they lift rust-colored dust into the atmosphere that can cover the entire planet. Mars also experiences quakes orbiters that are monitoring the climate on Mars act as weather satellites warning astronauts of incoming dust storms and changes in the weather.
The two-year-long work schedule begins. Days on the red planet are a little over 24 hours. The workday of unpacking and carrying heavy objects is made easier as the gravity on Mars is only 38% of that on earth. Once the life support systems have been unpacked and deployed, the next priority is testing and starting production of cryomethane fuel. The fuel is needed for the return trip to earth. A small crew of astronauts begin conducting experiments that test turning the martian soil into a 3D printing material. The green project also gets underway to start growing plants indoors. Settlers begin cultivating the martian soil.
NASA has packed designer plants that have been genetically engineered to grow on Mars and testing begins on the cyanobacteria that was transported from earth. This organism is used to produce ammonia fertilizer from the nitrogen in the martian atmosphere. Crops such as rye, radishes, tomatoes, beans, carrots and potatoes are grown, and the astronauts waste is recycled as fertilizer for the plants. Soon the Mars base will have a delivery of fishes.
On earth, SpaceX now has factories that are producing two starships per week. Each one costing five million dollars to build, 104 starships are built per year and 216 starships are ready for each launch window. Earth and Mars orbit around the sun at different speeds, so there is only a launch window every two years and two months when earth and Mars are at their closest. During each launch window year there are only a few days as low as 12 to launch, and four each day the launch window ranges from only 30 minutes to 2 hours, so a combination of cargo and crude starships are built waiting ready to be launched when the window opens.
Back on Mars, one starship launches heading back to earth, carrying on board the entire 30-person crew who have lived on the red planet for over two years.

          The butterfly effect is the idea that small, seemingly trivial events may ultimately result in something with much larger consequences – in other words, they have non-linear impacts on very complex systems. For instance, when a butterfly flaps its wings in India, that tiny change in air pressure could eventually cause a tornado in Iowa.
The term “butterfly effect” was coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz, a meteorology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was studying weather patterns. He devised a model demonstrating that if you compare two starting points indicating current weather that are near each other, they’ll soon drift apart – and later, one area could wind up with severe storms, while the other is calm.
Later, other scientists realized the importance of Lorenz’s discovery. His insights laid the foundation for a branch of mathematics known as chaos theory, the idea of trying to predict the behavior of systems that are inherently unpredictable.
You can see instances of the butterfly effect every day. Weather’s just one example. Climate change is another. Because, as it turns out, warming climates are impacting – appropriately enough – species of alpine butterflies in North America.
蝴蝶效应是混沌学理论中的一个概念。它是指对初始条件敏感性的一种依赖现象：输入端微小的差别会迅速放大到输出端，蝴蝶效应在经济生活中比比皆是。
“蝴蝶效应”也可称“台球效应”，它是“混沌性系统”对初值极为敏感的形象化术语，也是非线性系统在一定条件（可称为“临界性条件”或“阈值条件”）出现混沌现象的直接原因。
混沌不是偶然的、个别的事件，而是普遍存在于宇宙间各种各样的宏观及微观系统的，万事万物，莫不混沌。
混沌也不是独立存在的科学，它与其它各门科学互相促进、互相依靠，由此派生出许多交叉学科，如混沌气象学、混沌经济学、混沌数学等。
混沌学不仅极具研究价值，而且有现实应用价值，能直接或间接创造财富。

          The immune system is a network of biological processes that protects an organism from diseases. It detects and responds to a wide variety of pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, as well as cancer cells and objects such as wood splinters, distinguishing them from the organism’s own healthy tissue. Many species have two major subsystems of the immune system. The innate immune system provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli. The adaptive immune system provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered. Both use molecules and cells to perform their functions.
Nearly all organisms have some kind of immune system. Bacteria have a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against virus infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient plants and animals and remain in their modern descendants. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt to recognize pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.

          The respiratory system is the organs and other parts of your body involved in breathing,when you exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Parts of the Respiratory System
Nose and nasal cavity
Sinuses
Mouth
Throat (pharynx)
Voice box (larynx)
Windpipe (trachea)
Diaphragm
Lungs
Bronchial tubes&#x2F;bronchi
Bronchioles
Air sacs (alveoli)
Capillaries

How Do We Breathe?Breathing starts when you inhale air into your nose or mouth.It travels down the back of your throat and into your windpipe,which is divided into air passages called bronchial tubes.
For your lungs to perform their best, these airways need to be open.They should be free from inflammation or swelling and extra mucus.
As the bronchial tubes pass through your lungs,they divide into smaller air passages called bronchioles.The bronchioles end in tiny balloon-like air sacs called alveoli.Your body has about 600 million alveoli.
The alveoli are surrounded by a mesh of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.Here, oxygen from inhaled air passes into your blood.
After absorbing oxygen, blood goes to your heart.Your heart then pumps it through your body to the cells of your tissues and organs.
As the cells use the oxygen, they make carbon dioxide that goes into your blood.Your blood then carries the carbon dioxide back to your lungs,where it’s removed from your body when you exhale.
当您将空气吸入鼻子或嘴中时，呼吸开始。
它沿着您的喉咙后部行进，进入您的气管，气管分为称为支气管的空气通道。
为了使您的肺部表现最佳，这些呼吸道需要打开。
他们应该没有发炎或肿胀和多余的黏液。
当支气管穿过肺部时，它们会分成较小的空气通道，称为细支气管。
细支气管终止于称为肺泡的微小气球状气囊。您的身体有大约6亿个肺泡。
肺泡被称为毛细血管的细小血管网包围。在这里，吸入空气中的氧气进入您的血液。
吸收氧气后，血液流到您的心脏。然后，心脏将其通过身体泵送到组织和器官的细胞。
当细胞使用氧气时，它们会产生二氧化碳，这些二氧化碳会进入您的血液。然后，血液将二氧化碳带回肺部，在呼气时将其从体内清除。

<p>A <strong>photonic quantum</strong> computer could have huge advantages over its matter-based counterpart. Photons are much less prone to interact with their environment, which means they can retain their quantum state for much longer and over long distances. A photonic quantum computer could, in theory, operate at room temperature – and as a result, scale up much faster.</p>
<p>Of the various approaches to quantum computing, photons are appealing for their low-noise properties and ease of manipulation at the single photon level; while the challenge of entangling interactions between photons can be met via measurement induced non-linearities.</p>

          Chinese people believe that we are surrounded by five energy fields or five different kinds of “Qì” (气). These are also called the “five elements” and they play an important role in all aspects of Chinese culture, including the way people eat. This theory states that if these five elements are changed or moved, this could seriously affect a person’s fate.
The “five elements” (五行) are also known as the five agents, five phases, five movements, five forces, five processes, and five planets.
If the concept of yīn and yáng is the center of the Chinese culture, then the theory of the “five elements” should be treated as its cornerstone.

The Five Elements TheoryThe five elements are metal (金), wood (木), water (水), fire (火), and earth (土). Chinese people use this five elements theory for a lot of things, from the interaction between internal organs to politics, and Chinese medicine to cooking and food.
It’s just like finding the perfect balance yīn and yáng, it’s about trying to find the perfect balance between the five elements. There are two main relationships between these five elements. One is called “mutual generation (相生)” and the other one is called “mutual overcoming (相克).”
Examples of mutual generating:

Wood made Fire stronger.
Fire made Earth (ash).
Earth contained and bore Metal.
Metal improved the quality of the Water.
Water helps the Wood grow.

Example of mutual overcoming:

Earth can stop Water.
Water can stop a Fire.
Fire can melt Metal.
Metal can cut Wood.
Wood can consume Earth.

To give an example from nature, a plant (wood) grows when it is given water. When burnt, wood gives birth to fire, and the burnt ashes subsequently return to the earth.

          Maximum Normal Stress CriterionThe maximum stress criterion, also known as the normal stress, Coulomb, or Rankine criterion, is often used to predict the failure of brittle materials.The maximum stress criterion states that failure occurs when the maximum (normal) principal stress reaches either the uniaxial tension strength st, or the uniaxial compression strength sc,
$$-s_{c}&lt;\left{s_{1}, s_{2}\right}&lt;s_{t}$$
where $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are the principal stresses for 2D stress.
Graphically, the maximum stress criterion requires that the two principal stresses lie within the green zone depicted below,

Mohr’s TheoryThe Mohr Theory of Failure, also known as the Coulomb-Mohr criterion or internal-friction theory, is based on the famous Mohr’s Circle. Mohr’s theory is often used in predicting the failure of brittle materials, and is applied to cases of 2D stress.
Mohr’s theory suggests that failure occurs when Mohr’s Circle at a point in the body exceeds the envelope created by the two Mohr’s circles for uniaxial tensile strength and uniaxial compression strength. This envelope is shown in the figure below,

The left circle is for uniaxial compression at the limiting compression stress sc of the material. Likewise, the right circle is for uniaxial tension at the limiting tension stress st.
The middle Mohr’s Circle on the figure (dash-dot-dash line) represents the maximum allowable stress for an intermediate stress state.
All intermediate stress states fall into one of the four categories in the following table. Each case defines the maximum allowable values for the two principal stresses to avoid failure.

Graphically, Mohr’s theory requires that the two principal stresses lie within the green zone depicted below,

Also shown on the figure is the maximum stress criterion (dashed line). This theory is less conservative than Mohr’s theory since it lies outside Mohr’s boundary.

We know that when we apply loads to an object, like this bracket, if we keep increasing the magnitude of the load, at some point the material will fail. But how can we predict when static failure will occur? What level do the stresses in the object need to reach for it to fail? First we need to define what failure is. For ductile materials failure is usually considered to occur at the onset of plastic deformation. And for brittle materials it occurs at fracture. These points are easy to define for a uniaxial stress state, like a tensile test. They occur when the normal stress in the object reaches the yield strength of the material for ductile materials and the ultimate strength for brittle materials.


But for a more complex case of tri-axial stress, predicting failure is much less straightforward. In fact it’s so difficult to predict that we don’t have one universally applicable method. Instead, we have to predict failure by selecting the most suitable one of a range of different failure theories, each of which we know works relatively well under certain circumstances, based on experimentation. Because they fail in fundamentally different ways, failure theories which apply for ductile materials usually aren’t applicable for brittle materials, and vice-versa. So what does a failure theory do? It’s quite simple - it allows us to predict failure of a material by comparing the stress state in the object we are assessing with material properties that are easy to determine, like the yield or ultimate strengths of the material, that we can obtain by performing a uniaxial test.


The stress state at a point can be described using the three principal stresses, so most failure theories are defined as a function of the principal stresses and the material strength. Probably the simplest failure theory is to say that failure occurs when the maximum or minimum principal stresses reach the yield or ultimate strengths of the material. This is called Maximum Principal Stress theory, or Rankine theory. Although it’s simple to apply, it’s not actually a great failure theory, particularly for ductile materials, for reasons I’ll explain later. Let’s look at some better failure theories for ductile materials. Any good failure theory needs to be consistent with experimental observations we can make about how materials fail.


There is one key observation that failure theories for ductile materials need to capture, which is the fact that hydrostatic stresses do not cause yielding in ductile materials. Let me explain. A general tri-axial stress state like the one shown here can be decomposed into stresses which cause a change in volume, and stresses which cause shape distortion. Stresses that cause a change in volume are called hydrostatic stresses, because that is the type of stress acting on an object submerged in liquid.


For a hydrostatic stress configuration the three principal stresses are always equal, and there are no shear stresses. For a tri-axial stress state we can calculate the hydrostatic component as the average of the three principal stresses. The mechanism that causes yielding of ductile materials is shear deformation. Since there are no shear stresses for a state of hydrostatic stress, this component can be very large and still not contribute to yielding. Yielding is only caused by the stresses which cause shape distortion. These are called deviatoric stresses. The deviatoric component is calculated by subtracting the hydrostatic component from each of the principal stresses. The hydrostatic and deviatoric components can be expressed in matrix form, like this. Here we have described the stress state using the principal stresses, but we could also describe it for an arbitrary orientation of the stress element.


It can be helpful to use Mohr’s circle to understand the hydrostatic and deviatoric components of a tri-axial stress state. For a hydrostatic stress configuration there are no shear stresses, and so Mohr’s circle reduces to a single point, equal to the average of the three principal stresses. Shifting Mohr’s circle horizontally represents an increase in the hydrostatic component. And increasing the radius of Mohr’s circle without changing the average stress represents an increase in the deviatoric component. Since failure of ductile materials only depends on the deviatoric component, a good failure theory for ductile materials should produce the same result regardless of where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. This explains why Maximum Principal Stress theory is not a good failure theory for ductile materials - it isn’t consistent with the observation that yielding is independent of hydrostatic stress. Two failure theories which are consistent with this observation are the Tresca and von Mises failure criteria. These are the two most commonly used failure theories for ductile materials.


Let’s start with the Tresca failure criterion, which is also called the maximum shear stress theory. It is named after the French engineer Henri Tresca, and it states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress is equal to the shear stress at yielding in a tensile test. This can be defined mathematically, like this. And graphically using Mohr’s circle, like this. This theory is consistent with the observation that hydrostatic stresses don’t affect yield. It doesn’t care where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. It’s common to express this theory as a function of the principal stresses, instead of as a function of the shear stresses. We can see based on Mohr’s circle for a tri-axial stress state that the maximum shear stress is equal to the radius of the outer circle, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses, divided by 2. Mohr’s circle for a uniaxial tensile test at yielding looks like this. The intermediate and minimum principal stresses 𝞼₂ and 𝞼₃ are equal to zero, and the maximum principal stress 𝞼₁ is equal to the yield strength of the material. The shear stress at yielding is equal to half of the yield strength of the material, so we can re-write our equation to obtain the standard formulation for the Tresca theory.



Let’s look at the von Mises failure criterion next, which is also called the maximum distortion energy theory. It was initially developed by the Austrian scientist Richard von Mises, but a number of others were involved in refining it, so it is sometimes called the Maxwell–Huber–Hencky–von Mises theory. It states that yielding occurs when the maximum distortion energy in a material is equal to the distortion energy at yielding in a uniaxial tensile test.


So what is the distortion energy? It is essentially the portion of strain energy in a stressed element corresponding to the effect of the deviatoric stresses. The distortion energy per unit volume can be calculated from the principal stresses using this equation. We know that at yielding during a tensile test the maximum principal stress is equal to the yield strength of the material, and the two other principal stresses are equal to zero. So we can calculate the distortion energy at yielding in a tensile test by plugging in the appropriate principal stress values.


And by equating the distortion energy at yielding with the general equation for a tri-axial stress state, and re-arranging a bit, we get an equation that defines the von Mises failure criterion. Again we can see that this theory considers the difference between principal stresses, and so is independent of the hydrostatic stress. The term on the left is often called the equivalent von Mises stress. If it is larger than the yield strength of the material, yielding is predicted to have occurred.


The equivalent von Mises stress is a common output from stress analysis performed using the finite element method. Contour plots are typically generated to show the distribution of the von Mises equivalent stress within a component, as these allow areas at risk of yielding to be identified. When comparing failure theories it can be useful to plot their yield surfaces. A yield surface is the representation of a failure theory in the principal stress space, which sounds more complicated than it actually is. To keep things simple let’s start by considering a plane stress case, where one of the three principal stresses is equal to zero. By convention principal stresses are ordered from largest to smallest, like this, but since we don’t know yet how the stresses will be ordered, I’ll refer to them as 𝞼A, 𝞼B, and 𝞼C instead. We’ll say that 𝞼C is equal to zero, and so the two axes of our yield surface graph correspond to the two non-zero principal stresses, 𝞼A and 𝞼B.


The yield surface for the Maximum Principal Stress theory is easy to plot - it says that yielding begins when either of these principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material, so it looks like this. Yielding is considered to have occurred when the stress state reaches this line. Next let’s plot the yield surface for the Tresca theory. This theory states that yielding occurs when the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material. But it’s not as simple as taking the difference between 𝞼A and 𝞼B. Plane stress is still a three-dimensional stress state. In the top right quadrant of the graph both 𝞼A and 𝞼B are positive, and so 𝞼C, which is equal to zero, is the minimum principal stress. The yield surface looks like this. But in the bottom right quadrant 𝞼B is negative, and so 𝞼B is the minimum principal stress. That gives us a yield surface that looks like this.


Repeating this process for the other two quadrants completes the Tresca yield surface. von Mises yield theory for plane stress conditions is defined using this equation when expressed in terms of the principal stresses. We can square both sides of the equation and see that it is of the same form as an ellipse, which gives us the von Mises yield surface. Let’s plot some experimental data for tests performed on ductile materials and see how each of these theories compares. It’s clear that the Maximum Principal Stress theory has large areas where its use is potentially unsafe. So let’s get rid of it, and compare Tresca and von Mises. Both agree well with experimental observations, although von Mises agrees slightly better. The Tresca yield surface lies entirely inside the von Mises surface, meaning that Tresca is more conservative.


If we assume that the principal stresses will increase in proportion to one another as a load is applied, and so the stress paths are straight lines, the difference between the Tresca and von Mises theories is largest for these three configurations. The maximum difference between the two theories can be calculated to be 15.5%. von Mises is usually preferred to Tresca because it agrees better with experimental data, but Tresca is sometimes used because it is easier to apply and it is more conservative. So far we have looked at a plane stress case, with 𝞼C equal to zero. But for a general three-dimensional stress state, 𝞼C will be non-zero. We know that the Tresca and von Mises yield surfaces aren’t affected by hydrostatic stresses, and so to obtain the yield surfaces in three dimensions we just need to extend the plane stress yield surfaces along the hydrostatic axis.


Failure of brittle materials is different to failure of ductile materials. For brittle materials, failure is considered to occur by fracture rather than yielding. And unlike ductile materials, brittle materials tend to have compressive strengths that are much larger than their tensile strengths. This needs to be captured in any failure theory for brittle materials. It also means that to assess failure of brittle materials we need to know two separate ultimate strengths, for tension and for compression.


Coulomb-Mohr theory is a failure theory often used for brittle materials. Unlike the theories we have seen for ductile materials, it considers failure to be sensitive to hydrostatic stresses, and captures the difference between tensile and compressive ultimate strengths. The easiest way to define this theory is using Mohr’s circle. We start by drawing the Mohr’s circles corresponding to failure in the uniaxial tensile and compressive tests. By drawing lines tangent to both circles we create a failure envelope.


Coulomb-Mohr theory states that a material will fail for a stress-state with a Mohr’s circle that reaches this envelope. The Tresca yield criterion we saw earlier is actually a special case of the Coulomb-Mohr failure theory, where we have the same material properties in tension and in compression. The plane stress failure surface for Coulomb-Mohr theory looks like this.



As you can see it doesn’t agree particularly well with experimental data in the bottom right quadrant. Modified Mohr theory is a slight variation on the theory, which better fits experimental data. It is one of the preferred general failure theories for brittle materials. Because failure theories for brittle materials need to account for the effect of hydrostatic stresses, these failure theories converge to a point when extended along the hydrostatic axis. And that’s it for this introduction to failure theories! We’ve covered the most common theories, but there are many more out there which may be more appropriate for specific scenarios.

          Riemann hypothesis, in number theory, hypothesis by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann concerning the location of solutions to the Riemann zeta function, which is connected to the prime number theorem and has important implications for the distribution of prime numbers. Riemann included the hypothesis in a paper, “Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse” (“On the Number of Prime Numbers Less Than a Given Quantity”), published in the November 1859 edition of Monatsberichte der Berliner Akademie (“Monthly Review of the Berlin Academy”).


Other than the “trivial zeros” along the negative real axis,
all the solutions to the Riemann zeta function must lie in the critical strip of complex numbers whose 
real part is between 0 and 1. The Riemann hypothesis is that all these nontrivial zeros actually lie on 
the critical line, or $Re(S) &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$.

The zeta function is defined as the infinite series
$$\zeta(s)&#x3D;1+2^{-s}+3^{-s}+4^{-s}+\cdots$$
or, in more compact notation,
$$\zeta(s)&#x3D;\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}}$$
where the summation $(Σ)$ of terms for n runs from 1 to infinity through the positive integers and s is a fixed positive integer greater than 1. The zeta function was first studied by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. (For this reason, it is sometimes called the Euler zeta function. For $ζ(1)$, this series is simply the harmonic series, known since antiquity to increase without bound — i.e., its sum is infinite.) 
Euler achieved instant fame when he proved in 1735 that $ζ(2) &#x3D; π^{2}&#x2F;6$, a problem that had eluded the greatest mathematicians of the era, including the Swiss Bernoulli family (Jakob, Johann, and Daniel). More generally, Euler discovered (1739) a relation between the value of the zeta function for even integers and the Bernoulli numbers, which are the coefficients in the Taylor series expansion of $x&#x2F;(e^{x} − 1)$. (See also exponential function.) Still more amazing, in 1737 Euler discovered a formula relating the zeta function, which involves summing an infinite sequence of terms containing the positive integers, and an infinite product that involves every prime number:
$$\zeta(s)&#x3D;\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}}&#x3D;\prod_{p} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$
Riemann extended the study of the zeta function to include the complex numbers $x + iy$, where $i &#x3D; \sqrt{−1}$, except for the line $x &#x3D; 1$ in the complex plane. Riemann knew that the zeta function equals zero for all negative even integers −2, −4, −6, … (so-called trivial zeros) and that it has an infinite number of zeros in the critical strip of complex numbers that fall strictly between the lines $x &#x3D; 0$ and $x &#x3D; 1$. He also knew that all nontrivial zeros are symmetric with respect to the critical line $x &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$. Riemann conjectured that all of the nontrivial zeros are on the critical line, a conjecture that subsequently became known as the Riemann hypothesis.
In 1914 English mathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy proved that an infinite number of solutions of $ζ(s) &#x3D; 0$ exist on the critical line $x &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$. Subsequently it was shown by various mathematicians that a large proportion of the solutions must lie on the critical line, though the frequent “proofs” that all the nontrivial solutions are on it have been flawed. Computers have also been used to test solutions, with the first 10 trillion nontrivial solutions shown to lie on the critical line.
A proof of the Riemann hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography.
The Riemann hypothesis has long been considered the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics. It was one of 10 unsolved mathematical problems (23 in the printed address) presented as a challenge for 20th-century mathematicians by German mathematician David Hilbert at the Second International Congress of Mathematics in Paris on Aug. 8, 1900.
In 2000 American mathematician Stephen Smale updated Hilbert’s idea with a list of important problems for the 21st century; the Riemann hypothesis was number one.In 2000 it was designated a Millennium Problem, one of seven mathematical problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., U.S., for a special award. The solution for each Millennium Problem is worth $1 million.In 2008 the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) listed it as one of the DARPA Mathematical Challenges, 23 mathematical problems for which it was soliciting research proposals for funding — “Mathematical Challenge Nineteen: Settle the Riemann Hypothesis. The Holy Grail of number theory.”

          DivergenceDivergence is an operation on a vector field that tells us how the field behaves toward or away from a point. Locally, the divergence of a vector field $\vec{F}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ at a particular point $P$ is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of the vector field at $P$.If $\vec{F}$ represents the velocity of a fluid, then the divergence of $\vec{F}$ at $P$ measures the net rate of change with respect to time of the amount of fluid flowing away from $P$ (the tendency of the fluid to flow “out of” P). In particular, if the amount of fluid flowing into $P$ is the same as the amount flowing out, then the divergence at $P$ is zero.
Definition: divergence in $\mathbb{R}^3$If $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q,R \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $P_x, , Q_y,$ and $R_z$ all exist, then the divergence of $\vec{F}$ is defined by
$$\begin{aligned}\operatorname{div} F &amp;&#x3D;P_{x}+Q_{y}+R_{z} \&amp;&#x3D;\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial R}{\partial z}\end{aligned}$$
Note the divergence of a vector field is not a vector field, but a scalar function. In terms of the gradient operator
$$\vec{\nabla}&#x3D;\left\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right\rangle$$
divergence can be written symbolically as the dot product
$$\operatorname{div} \vec{F}&#x3D;\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{F}.$$
Note this is merely helpful notation, because the dot product of a vector of operators and a vector of functions is not meaningfully defined given our current definition of dot product.
If $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , and $P_{x}$ and $Q_{y}$ both exist, then the divergence of $\vec{F}$ is defined similarly as
$$\begin{aligned}\operatorname{div} \vec{F} &amp;&#x3D;P_{x}+Q_{y} \&amp;&#x3D;\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y} \&amp;&#x3D;\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{F}\end{aligned}.$$
To illustrate this point, consider the two vector fields in Figure 1. At any particular point, the amount flowing in is the same as the amount flowing out, so at every point the “outflowing-ness” of the field is zero. Therefore, we expect the divergence of both fields to be zero, and this is indeed the case, as
$$\text{div}(\langle 1,2 \rangle ) &#x3D; \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (1) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}(2) &#x3D; 0$$
and
$$\text{div}(\langle -y,x \rangle ) &#x3D; \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-y) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (x) &#x3D; 0.$$


Figure 1: (a) Vector field ⟨1, 2⟩ has zero divergence. (b) Vector field ⟨−𝑦, 𝑥⟩ also has zero divergence.

By contrast, consider radial vector field $\vec{R}(x, y)&#x3D;\langle-x,-y\rangle$ in Figure 2. At any given point, more fluid is flowing in than is flowing out, and therefore the “outgoingness” of the field is negative. We expect the divergence of this field to be negative, and this is indeed the case, as
$$\operatorname{div}(\vec{R})&#x3D;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(-x)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(-y)&#x3D;-2$$


Figure 2: This vector field has negative divergence.

To get a global sense of what divergence is telling us, suppose that a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^2$ represents the velocity of a fluid. Imagine taking an elastic circle (a circle with a shape that can be changed by the vector field) and dropping it into a fluid. If the circle maintains its exact area as it flows through the fluid, then the divergence is zero. This would occur for both vector fields in Figure 1. On the other hand, if the circle’s shape is distorted so that its area shrinks or expands, then the divergence is not zero. Imagine dropping such an elastic circle into the radial vector field in Figure 2 so that the center of the circle lands at point (3, 3). The circle would flow toward the origin, and as it did so the front of the circle would travel more slowly than the back, causing the circle to “scrunch” and lose area. This is how you can see a negative divergence.
CurlThe second operation on a vector field that we examine is the curl, which measures the extent of rotation of the field about a point. Suppose that $\vec{F}$ represents the velocity field of a fluid. Then, the curl of $\vec{F}$ at point $P$ is a vector that measures the tendency of particles near $P$ to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of this vector. The magnitude of the curl vector at $P$ measures how quickly the particles rotate around this axis. In other words, the curl at a point is a measure of the vector field’s “spin” at that point. Visually, imagine placing a paddlewheel into a fluid at $P$ , with the axis of the paddlewheel aligned with the curl vector (Figure 3). The curl measures the tendency of the paddlewheel to rotate.


Figure 3: To visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a small paddlewheel into the vector field at a point.

Consider the vector fields in Figure 1. In part (a), the vector field is constant and there is no spin at any point. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be zero, and this is indeed the case. Part (b) shows a rotational field, so the field has spin. In particular, if you place a paddlewheel into a field at any point so that the axis of the wheel is perpendicular to a plane, the wheel rotates counterclockwise. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be nonzero, and this is indeed the case (the curl is $2,\mathbf{\hat k}$).
To see what curl is measuring globally, imagine dropping a leaf into the fluid. As the leaf moves along with the fluid flow, the curl measures the tendency of the leaf to rotate. If the curl is zero, then the leaf doesn’t rotate as it moves through the fluid.
Definition: CurlIf $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q,R \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $P_x, , Q_y,$ and $R_z$ all exist, then the curl of $\vec{F}$ is defined by
$$\begin{aligned}\operatorname{curl} \vec{F} &amp;&#x3D;\left(\boldsymbol{R}{y}-Q{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\left(\boldsymbol{P}{z}-\boldsymbol{R}{x}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(Q_{x}-\boldsymbol{P}_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}} \&amp;&#x3D;\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{R}}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{R}}{\partial x}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}\end{aligned}$$
Note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field, in contrast to divergence.
The definition of curl can be difficult to remember. To help with remembering, we use the notation $\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{F}$ to stand for a “determinant” that gives the curl formula:
$$\left|\begin{array}{ccc}\hat{i} &amp; \hat{j} &amp; \hat{k} \\frac{\partial}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \P &amp; Q &amp; R\end{array}\right|.$$
The determinant of this matrix is
$$\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}-\left(R_{x}-P_{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\left(P_{z}-R_{x}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\operatorname{curl} \vec{F}.$$
Thus, this matrix is a way to help remember the formula for curl. Keep in mind, though, that the word determinant is used very loosely. A determinant is not really defined on a matrix with entries that are three vectors, three operators, and three functions.
If $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , then the curl of $\vec{F}$ , by definition, is
$$\operatorname{curl} \vec{F}&#x3D;\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}$$
