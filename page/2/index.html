          In physics and relativity, Time Dilation is the difference in the elapsed time as measured by two clocks. It is either due to a relative velocity between them (“kinetic” time dilation, from special relativity) or to a difference in gravitational potential between their locations (gravitational time dilation, from general relativity). When unspecified, “time dilation” usually refers to the effect due to velocity. After compensating for varying signal delays due to the changing distance between an observer and a moving clock (i.e. Doppler effect), the observer will measure the moving clock as ticking slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer’s own reference frame. In addition, a clock that is close to a massive body (and which therefore is at lower gravitational potential) will record less elapsed time than a clock situated further from the said massive body (and which is at a higher gravitational potential). These predictions of the theory of relativity have been repeatedly confirmed by experiment, and they are of practical concern, for instance in the operation of satellite navigation systems such as GPS and Galileo.

High-accuracy timekeeping, low-Earth-orbit satellite tracking, and pulsar timing are applications that require the consideration of the combined effects of mass and motion in producing time dilation. Practical examples include the International Atomic Time standard and its relationship with the Barycentric Coordinate Time standard used for interplanetary objects.
Relativistic time dilation effects for the solar system and the Earth can be modeled very precisely by the Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations. In the Schwarzschild metric, the interval $d t_{\mathrm{E}}$ is given by:
$$d t_{\mathrm{E}}^{2}&#x3D;\left(1-\frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{i}}}{r_{\mathrm{i}} c^{2}}\right) d t_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}-\left(1-\frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{i}}}{r_{\mathrm{i}} c^{2}}\right)^{-1} \frac{d x^{2}+d y^{2}+d z^{2}}{c^{2}}$$
where:

$d t_{\mathrm{E}}$ is a small increment of proper time $t_{\mathrm{E}}$ (an interval that could be recorded on an atomic clock),$d t_{\mathrm{c}}$ is a small increment in the coordinate $t_{\mathrm{c}}$ (coordinate time),dx, dy, dz are small increments in the three coordinates x, y, z of the clock’s position,$\frac{-G M_{i}}{r_{i}}$ represents the sum of the Newtonian gravitational potentials due to the masses in the neighborhood, based on their distances ${r_{i}}$ from the clock. This sum includes any tidal potentials.

The coordinate velocity of the clock is given by:
$$v^{2}&#x3D;\frac{d x^{2}+d y^{2}+d z^{2}}{d t_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}}$$
The coordinate time $t_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the time that would be read on a hypothetical “coordinate clock” situated infinitely far from all gravitational masses (U&#x3D;0), and stationary in the system of coordinates (v&#x3D;0). The exact relation between the rate of proper time and the rate of coordinate time for a clock with a radial component of velocity is:
$$\frac{d t_{\mathrm{E}}}{d t_{\mathrm{c}}}&#x3D;\sqrt{1+\frac{2 U}{c^{2}}-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}+\left(\frac{c^{2}}{2 U}+1\right)^{-1} \frac{v_{\text {॥ }}^{2}}{c^{2}}}&#x3D;\sqrt{1-\left(\beta^{2}+\beta_{e}^{2}+\frac{\beta_{\text {॥ }}^{2} \beta_{e}^{2}}{1-\beta_{e}^{2}}\right)}$$
where:

$v_{\text {॥ }}^{2}$ is the radial velocity,$v_{e}&#x3D;\sqrt{\frac{2 G M_{i}}{r_{i}}}$ is the escape speed,$\beta&#x3D;v &#x2F; c$, $\beta_{e}&#x3D;v_{e} &#x2F; c$, $\beta_{\text {॥ }}&#x3D;v_{\text {॥ }} &#x2F; c$ are velocities as a percentage of speed of light c,$U&#x3D;\frac{-G M_{i}}{r_{i}}$ is the Newtonian potential; hence -U equals half the square of the escape speed.

The above equation is exact under the assumptions of the Schwarzschild solution. It reduces to velocity time dilation equation in the presence of motion and absence of gravity, i.e. $\beta_{e}&#x3D;0$. It reduces to gravitational time dilation equation in the absence of motion and presence of gravity, i.e. $\beta&#x3D;0&#x3D;\beta_{\text {॥ }}$.

One evening in the spring of 1905, Albert Einstein, then a patent clerk in Bern, after trudging through his day’s work decided to board a tram car on his way home. Einstein would often wrap up his work as soon as possible to contemplate the truths of the universe in his free time. It was one of these thought experiments he devised on that tram car that revolutionized modern physics forever. While receding away from the Zytglogge clock tower, Einstein imagined, what would happen if the tram car were receding at the speed of light. He realized that if he were to travel at 186,000 miles per second the clocks hands would appear to completely freeze. At the same time Einstein knew that back at the clock tower the hands would tick along at their normal pace. For Einstein, time had slowed down. This thought blew his mind. Einstein concluded that the faster you move through space the slower you move through time.


How is this possible? Einstein’s work was heavily influenced by two of the most iconic physicists of all time. First there were the laws of motion discovered by his idol Isaac Newton and second were the laws of electromagnetism, laid down by James Clerk Maxwell. Newton’s laws insisted that velocities are never absolute. But always relative, so that their magnitudes must be appended by the phrase “with respect to”. For instance, a train travels at 40 km&#x2F;h with respect to someone at rest. However, it only travels 20 km&#x2F;h with respect to a train traveling 20 km&#x2F;h in the same direction. Or it travels 60 km&#x2F;h with respect to another train traveling in the opposite direction at 20 km&#x2F;h. This is also true for the velocities of Earth, the Sun and the entire Milky Way galaxy. On the other hand Maxwell found that the speed of an electromagnetic wave such as light is fixed at an exorbitant 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s, regardless of who observes it. However Maxwell’s notion seems incompatible with Newton’s notion of relative velocities. If Newton’s laws are truly universal, why should the speed of life be an exception? This presented Einstein with a daunting dilemma. This conflict between the ideas of Newton and Maxwell can be demonstrated with another of Einstein’s brilliant thought experiments.


Einstein imagined himself on a train platform, witnessing two lightning bolts strike on either side of him. Now because Einstein stands precisely in the middle of the two strikes. He receives the resulting beams of light from both sides at the same time. However, things get more complicated when someone on a passing train views this event while whizzing past Einstein at the speed of light. If the speed of light conforms to the rules of relativity, then the person on the train wouldn’t witness the lightning strike simultaneously. Logically the light closer to the man on the train would reach him first. A measurement of the speed of light made by both men would differ in magnitude, this would contradict an apparently fundamental truth of the universe. Einstein had to make a difficult choice. Either Newton’s laws were incomplete or the speed of light was not a universal constant.


Einstein realized that the two notions could coexist with a small tweak in Newton’s laws. To get rid of the discrepancy in the measurements, Einstein suggested the time itself for the man on the train must slow down to compensate for the decrease in speed, such that the magnitude remains a constant. Einstein called this absurdity “Time Dilation” and his newfound theory “Special Relativity”. Newton believed the time moved unflinchingly in a single direction forward. Einstein, however had just realized the time stretches and contracts varying with velocity. Due to its malleability time like space Deserved its own dimension. In fact Einstein claimed that the two were one and the same.  Together they formed a four-dimensional fabric or continuum called space-time upon which the mundane events of the universe would unfold.


Einstein Suggested that massive objects like the Sun didn’t pull bodies like earth with a mysterious Inexplicable tug, but rather curved the fabric of space-time around them, forcing earth to fall down into this steep valley. A highly simplified analogy is the dip in a trampoline made by a falling bowling ball. If a marble were placed on that trampoline the marble would immediately roll towards the bowling ball in the center. This is also true for Earth’s gravity. We are pinned to the ground because space so distorted by the Earth’s mass, pushes us down from above. However the slump in the fabric around Earth is not uniform and Earth’s gravity grows more intense as we move towards its center, where the curvature is at a maximum. Therefore like the marble on the trampoline an object that falls towards the earth accelerates as it races towards the center of the planet. It falls faster when just above the surface than it does say when it is slightly above the atmosphere. But hey, according to special relativity, the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. This means that time runs slower on Earth’s surface than it does above the atmosphere. Now, because different planets have different masses and thus different gravitational strengths, they also accelerate objects at different rates as we have learned this means a variable passage of time. This is what happens in the movie interstellar when the protagonists land on a planet in the proximity of a black hole, the gravity on the planet is so severe that one hour on the surface is equivalent to seven years on earth.


To understand how motion affects time, let’s consider the simplest timekeeping mechanism. A second passes each time the photon is reflected. Let’s imagine two people one in a spaceship slightly above Earth’s atmosphere, and the second on top of a small hill, just above the Earth’s surface. Both are watching a man fall from space towards the ground. Let’s say that the falling man is carrying the photon clock explained a moment ago. What do each of the two men observe as the man falls past them? What they observe is eerily similar to what a stationary person would observe, when watching a ball bounce in a moving train? As the man falls from space, the light in his clock would appear to move in triangles to the two observers. This would mean that the light travels a longer distance consequently stretching the duration of a second. It is obvious that the length of triangles the light traces and therefore the duration of a second is proportional to the velocity of the falling man. When we recall that objects closer to the center of the planet fall faster, we can determine the time would appear to pass slower to the man on the hill than it does to the man in the spaceship above. Of course the difference is infinitesimal. The difference between the time measured by clocks at the tops of mountains and at the surface of Earth is a matter of nanoseconds. Time Dilation affects every clock whether it relies on basic electromagnetism or a complex combination of Electromagnetism and Newton’s laws of motion. In fact even biological processes are slowed down. Yes, that’s right, your head is slightly older than your feet.

2024, LandingFive starships land on Mars, marking the beginnings of the Mars colony.All of the martian rovers sent by different countries before this day.Watch as the five uncrewed starships land and deliver life support systems,these pioneering starships pave the way for humans to land on Mars in two years time, for fishes to be grown in nine years, and for the first baby to be born on the red planet in 15 years time.
27 April 2025, Location: Erebus MontesThe five starships land at Erebus Montes.The cargo ships are delivering essential life support systems.These are made up of solar panels backup fuel, oxygen, water, dried food,waste management systems, spacesuits, medical supplies and the first habitation pods.There are also tools and equipment for experiments.
One of the starships is carrying Mars’s new starlink communications network, and deploys it in orbit before landing to deliver life-support cargo. Only four satellites are needed to create the martian starlink, as the Mars base will be concentrated to one area. There are also seven football fields worth of solar panels on the cargo list.These are used to power the future base and fuel production solar panels on Mars are only 43% as efficient as they are on earth.
Rovers as well as robotic dogs by Boston Dynamics which SpaceX uses to inspect rockets on earth are deployed from the starships to the martian surface. Work begins on setting up the Mars base, the rovers and robots deploy the solar arrays, prep work begins for fuel production experiments, rovers begin drilling for icy water deposits. The saboteer process is used to take the CO² from the martian atmosphere and hydrogen from mining martian icy water, and then uses heat and pressure to turn it into water oxygen and methane fuel. Multi-use rovers begin flattening and melting the martian regolith the loose soil to prepare a large flat landing pad it reduces the kick-up of dirt and rocks, increasing the safety for the next landings. The population on Mars is made up entirely of robots two years and two months have passed since the first landings of the five cargo starships and the new launch window opens as earth and Mars are close together again.
20 June 2027, Day 1Two starships carrying a total of 30 astronauts land on Mars, 10 additional cargo ships accompany them carrying an oversupply of life support. These first astronaut settlers are scientists, engineers, medical specialists and military personnel with scientific backgrounds. They all have to stay on Mars for the full two years and two months.
This is not a short-term visit. It is a mission to make life sustainable and multi-planetary. During the first week on Mars, the astronauts are suffering from the effects of low gravity after the seven month journey and have weaker muscles. The first week is used to acclimate to the gravity of the red planet and celebrate surviving the journey. The new settlers live in their starships that they landed in the crew begins to adapt to their new surroundings.
Life on Mars is harsh. The average temperature outside is -63°C or -81°F with a maximum of 20°C (68°F) in the summer at the equator. Wind storms are common on Mars they lift rust-colored dust into the atmosphere that can cover the entire planet. Mars also experiences quakes orbiters that are monitoring the climate on Mars act as weather satellites warning astronauts of incoming dust storms and changes in the weather.
The two-year-long work schedule begins. Days on the red planet are a little over 24 hours. The workday of unpacking and carrying heavy objects is made easier as the gravity on Mars is only 38% of that on earth. Once the life support systems have been unpacked and deployed, the next priority is testing and starting production of cryomethane fuel. The fuel is needed for the return trip to earth. A small crew of astronauts begin conducting experiments that test turning the martian soil into a 3D printing material. The green project also gets underway to start growing plants indoors. Settlers begin cultivating the martian soil.
NASA has packed designer plants that have been genetically engineered to grow on Mars and testing begins on the cyanobacteria that was transported from earth. This organism is used to produce ammonia fertilizer from the nitrogen in the martian atmosphere. Crops such as rye, radishes, tomatoes, beans, carrots and potatoes are grown, and the astronauts waste is recycled as fertilizer for the plants. Soon the Mars base will have a delivery of fishes.
On earth, SpaceX now has factories that are producing two starships per week. Each one costing five million dollars to build, 104 starships are built per year and 216 starships are ready for each launch window. Earth and Mars orbit around the sun at different speeds, so there is only a launch window every two years and two months when earth and Mars are at their closest. During each launch window year there are only a few days as low as 12 to launch, and four each day the launch window ranges from only 30 minutes to 2 hours, so a combination of cargo and crude starships are built waiting ready to be launched when the window opens.
Back on Mars, one starship launches heading back to earth, carrying on board the entire 30-person crew who have lived on the red planet for over two years.
11 July 2029, Day 752With the landing of the second group of settlers, humans now surpass robots as the majority population. The first architect arrives along with four privately paying individuals who are paying 50 million dollars each. The rest of the crew are scientists, engineers and botanist farmers. The first set of small permanent greenhouse domes are constructed, adding to the number of plants being grown on Mars.
The settlers eat the first martian salad. A small portion of the food on the planet now comes from locally grown produce. This slowly reduces the amount of food that needs to be transported from earth on future missions. 
SpaceX begins construction of the Depot X. The first permanent dedicated fueling station on Mars, and work begins on the first 3D printed habitat. The AI space factory 3D printer uses a mixture of martian soil and lab-grown plants which act as the glue, the polymer that holds the material together. The 3D printed outer shell of the new habitat provides protection from radiation while an inflatable inner shell is added for extra safety. Parts are deconstructed from one of the starships to create the communications and life support systems for the new 3D printed habitat.
18 August 2031, Day 1520As more sophisticated 3D printing robots arrive, larger hydroponic crop facilities are built, generating the majority of the food for the martian settlers. Kimball musk even has a team working on Mars with their own vertical farm. The settlers begin testing underground digging for habitat purposes, data is sent back to the boring company on earth.
24 September 2033, Day 2288Space agencies from all around the world are now sending their own equipment and scientists to Mars base alpha. The domain name amazon.Mars is registered by Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin plans to open for delivery to Mars for space agencies first and then later for private clients. The new starship crew have transported fishes from earth to create an aquaponic greenhouse as there is now enough water being made on Mars. The first funeral is held, the settler is cremated and spread across the martian landscape.
Back at earth a fleet of starships full of fuel cargo and passengers is waiting in low earth orbit. When the launch window opens, they fly as a fleet to Mars the spacecrafts are able to support and dock with each other if needed during the seven month journey.
17 November 2035, Day 3072The year 2035, this year will be known as the great crossing earth and Mars are closer than usual this is known as a perihelic opposition the journey is shortened from seven months to five. Hundreds of settlers now land on the red planet, autonomous industrial scale 3D printers are now used to grow the base. The international habitat expands, and becomes a town-sized settlement of interconnected domes. The construction of the first martian hospital begins and a growing number of people decide to remain on Mars as more facilities are built.
10 February 2038, Day 3888The first people with the intention of becoming permanent residents arrive on Mars. The colony crosses the 1,000 person mark. There is even a small scale TV show that is made on the red planet. The first martian marriage is watched across earth and Mars while exploration missions discover cave systems suitable for the development of protected underground habitats.
20 April 2040, Day 4688The Boring Company tunnel digger lands on Mars, and begins testing digging underground tunnels for shielded passageways, and for underground habitat construction. This marks the beginning of Elon Musk’s Boring Mars Company. Robotic bases are now present at different locations, further away from the main base. They act as mining outposts and nation states begin constructing smaller habitats away from the base. They become embassies on Mars and architectural design moves habitats from purely functional constructions to expressive symbols of national pride. The first person is born on Mars, scientists study the health of the mother and baby closely.
19 June 2042, Day 5478A large number of the new arrivals are now commercially paying two-year stay customers. All travelers are still required to contribute in growing the Mars society. With over 7,000 people now on Mars, the first martian political system is created. Local policies are needed to help govern the residents of Mars and keep pushing the mission of being self-sustaining as a matter of survival for the colony. The first restaurant opens on Mars serving bio-printed food including meat.
17 August 2044, Day 6268The first bio-printer arrives, it is used at the hospital to test the printing of human parts.A dedicated maternity ward is opened at the hospital to deal with the increase of births from the martian residents. The first parts of a nuclear fusion power plant begins construction, reducing the need for additional solar panels that are sent with each mission from earth.
16 October 2046, Day 70582046, the year of the martian explorers. The first person climbs olympus mons. It is two and a half times taller than mount everest, making it the tallest mountain and volcano in the solar system. The nine and a half month journey tests the limits of the new flexible spacesuits.The first mrna manufacturing facility is operational, allowing the people of Mars to be vaccinated for when they return to earth. Schools are now being built as workers begin to move their families to Mars.
14 December 2048, Day 7848Blue Origin’s first fully autonomous orbiting manufacturing station arrives in Mars orbit. The space station processes asteroids for rare materials. It is done in space so that the Mars atmosphere is not polluted. Manufactured goods are then sent down to the martian surface.
Elon Musk opens the first Tesla Gigafactory on Mars. Here they recycle solar panel batteries and assemble open and enclosed electric transporters, and also maintain ATVs and other SpaceX transport vehicles.
12 February 2051, Day 8638The year 2051 is known as the second great crossing. The close orbits of earth and Mars allows for another mass movement of people and equipment. Tens of thousands of people land on the red planet. Government officials from different earth nations make the crossing. Mining companies send management teams and exploration geologists to the planet and establish small company habitats. AI robotics and a productive human workforce now makes Mars fully self-sufficient for all essential goods. The colony produces all of its own power, breathable air, water, food and fuel.
If resupply missions from earth were to stop, the Mars colony would survive and grow, but in a primitive way as there is still a need for advanced electronics from earth to keep the colony developing as an advanced civilization.
2 April 2053, Day 9418To mark the 10,000 days humans have settled on Mars, the first Mars-born human visits earth. The traveler is assisted by a robotic suit controlled by a neuralink brain chip that helps support them in the heavy earth gravity.
On Mars grasslands and woody plants are thriving in vast enclosed greenhouse domes built over melted ice lakes near the equator. They are slowly adding oxygen to the martian atmosphere. The first strands of grass are found growing wild on the martian surface escaped seedlings from the greenhouses are attempting to survive on the surface of Mars.

          The butterfly effect is the idea that small, seemingly trivial events may ultimately result in something with much larger consequences – in other words, they have non-linear impacts on very complex systems. For instance, when a butterfly flaps its wings in India, that tiny change in air pressure could eventually cause a tornado in Iowa.
The term “butterfly effect” was coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz, a meteorology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was studying weather patterns. He devised a model demonstrating that if you compare two starting points indicating current weather that are near each other, they’ll soon drift apart – and later, one area could wind up with severe storms, while the other is calm.
Later, other scientists realized the importance of Lorenz’s discovery. His insights laid the foundation for a branch of mathematics known as chaos theory, the idea of trying to predict the behavior of systems that are inherently unpredictable.
You can see instances of the butterfly effect every day. Weather’s just one example. Climate change is another. Because, as it turns out, warming climates are impacting – appropriately enough – species of alpine butterflies in North America.
蝴蝶效应是混沌学理论中的一个概念。它是指对初始条件敏感性的一种依赖现象：输入端微小的差别会迅速放大到输出端，蝴蝶效应在经济生活中比比皆是。
“蝴蝶效应”也可称“台球效应”，它是“混沌性系统”对初值极为敏感的形象化术语，也是非线性系统在一定条件（可称为“临界性条件”或“阈值条件”）出现混沌现象的直接原因。
混沌不是偶然的、个别的事件，而是普遍存在于宇宙间各种各样的宏观及微观系统的，万事万物，莫不混沌。
混沌也不是独立存在的科学，它与其它各门科学互相促进、互相依靠，由此派生出许多交叉学科，如混沌气象学、混沌经济学、混沌数学等。
混沌学不仅极具研究价值，而且有现实应用价值，能直接或间接创造财富。

In 1952, an author named Ray Bradbury published a short story called A Sound of Thunder, ended a hunter named Echolls pays $10,000 to travel with time Safari. A time machine company that takes hunters back to the time of dinosaurs and allows them to hunt the T-Rex. The company guarantees nothing, neither your safety nor your return, and there are strict instructions and expectations for how the hunters should behave once they travel back in time. When they travel 60 million years back in time, they noticed the path that has been laid by the company. It floats six inches above the earth, and is the only path that the hunter should travel upon. They cannot touch anything during their stay in the past and they’re only to shoot when told to. Interrupting any of the natural processes in the past could have irreparable repercussions for the future. Step on a mouse and you leave your print, like the Grand Canyon across eternity. They’re very careful with leaving the past just as it was supposed to unfold. The T-Rex that they were supposed to kill was going to be crushed by a tree only seconds later it was going to die anyway.


Echols however is terrified and runs back to the time machine through the jungle and waits for the others. But once the rest of the crew returns, they noticed the mud on that goes boots. Against their better judgment they allow him to return with the crew back to prison day. When they exit the time machine the crew checks in with the man behind the desk to see if everything is okay and the man tells him it is. The man however is acting a bit different from before they left there’s a strange smell in the air it’s faint but it’s there. The sign on the wall is different the words were spelled differently. Echols sits down that checks every inch of his body for things that could have ruined, and on his boot caked in the mud he finds a butterfly, beautiful and dead. The death of a single butterfly has somehow resulted in the future being changed, he cries out in this belief, begging to return to the past and somehow undo what he’s done. He sits down, with his eyes closed and senses a crew member enter the room. The crew member briefly and takes the safety off his rifle. Echols opens his eyes, but suddenly all he hears is a sound of thunder.


It used to be thought that events that changed the world were things like big bombs, huge earthquakes or other large-scale events. But has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that changed the world are the tiny things. A butterfly flapped its wings in the Amazon and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe. Paraphrased a little bit is a quote from a novel named Good Omens what it’s talking about is the butterfly effect. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions more commonly known as the Butterfly Effect is the idea that a small change in any situation could have huge implications later on down the road. The idea was coined by Edward Lorenz in the 1950s. Lorenz was a meteorologist to a surgery for a means of predicting the weather. He was conducting experiments with various numbers to try and model weather prediction. He did a previous experiment with an initial condition of 0.506127. Six significant digits, a little bit overkill he thought so this time his initial condition was only 0.506. Three significant digits should be fine. So we left the room to get a cup of coffee and came back to something drastically different from what he had previously. At first things seemed normal and they seemed to follow the first experiment one-to-one, but after a while they started to diverge and looked like completely different models. A 0.03% difference in values had enormous long-term implications. It may seem insignificant it’s just a model right. Well, Lorenz had actually just opened the door to a new way of thinking and seeing the world around us.


Chaos Theory is the branch of mathematics that focuses on exactly this kind of thinking. But its name is kind of deceiving. Butterfly Effect doesn’t represent chaos but rather the effects of changing the slightest conditions and then observing the results. Think of this it is easier to predict the orbital period of a planet in another star system ten million years from now, than it is for us to predict our own weather here on earth just a month from today. Because in order for us to predict the weather long term, we would have to know the exact position and momentum of every molecule of air on the planet and how they interact with each other. For planetary orbits it’s just a lot easier there’s a lot less of variables, and a university physics student could probably calculate it. As for the weather butterfly flapping his wings creates a minuscule and almost unnoticeable change in atmospheric pressure, but these changes compound over and over and over as time progresses, until as widely known the butterfly’s wings cause tornado in Texas.


This inevitable growth of errors is called Deterministic Chaos. Chaos that can be determined measured. However the butterfly itself cannot call as a tornado, the butterfly represents an unknowable quantity. We can never reverse-engineer an event to find out what exactly tipped the system, there’s just too many factors that could have gone into it no choice you’ve ever made has been an isolated event. It’s like a domino effect that keeps compounding over time. The world in society is like a network and when a certain part of that network fails it affects everything else. Chaos Theory isn’t random even though it seems like it. To prove it let’s play Chaos game. Take a piece of paper and make three points like such, we’ll label them A, B and C. Now choose a random point in the middle of those three points, we’ll just put it right here. Now all you have to do is make a point halfway between your starting point and point A, from this point make a point halfway between here and point B, repeat the process for Point C and continue this pattern, rotating between points A, B and C. If you do this for long enough you’ll see something interesting start to happen as more and more generations if these points are drawn an image starts to emerge. From seemingly random points being drawn, from Chaos, from disorder, this complexity yet orderly figure shows its face. From drawing a few points and following certain rules Chaos can form order. It’s a fractal they’re infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across any scale. This shows that with enough time random actions can have serious long-term effects.


The Butterfly Effect isn’t exactly how you’d expect science to be. Physics math and many other scientific fields are based on predictability. You know predicting the orbit of planets in order to send satellites of probes there, or predicting the odds of an asteroid hitting the earth. The Butterfly Effect is the complete opposite, it’s a model that exposes the flaws and other models. It says that without a perfect knowledge of initial conditions any prediction is basically useless. But although the Butterfly Effect exposes flaws and other models, it also brings to light the impact that everything including each of us has. Jonas Salk is credited for having found the first vaccines for polio. Had he not discovered that at the time he did, the entire population of the planet today would be vastly different, some people wouldn’t have been born. Entire family lines may have been cut off due to the lack of a vaccine. Perhaps some of the largest companies today would not have been created if it weren’t for this specific event happening at this specific time.


During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Russian nuclear armed submarines was stationed off the coast of Cuba. American ships detected the submarine and began using depth charges to signal that the submarine should surface. The crew on board though took these depth charges to be bombs, the captain that the ship believed that war had broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union, and ordered a nuclear torpedo to be sent immediately. Everyone agreed except for one officer Vasili arkhipov. Without a unanimous vote no action could be taken and thus World War III was prevented. This one man’s decision is the reason that the United States and Russia today aren’t nuclear wastelands.


The Butterfly Effect affects everything. Do you really have control of your life like everything. No, but you and I have huge effects on the world as well. The Butterfly Effect is not to get leverage, it’s not saying that every small thing always has a big impact. If that were true then in a way you couldn’t manipulate it. Think of it like Jenga, you take away a certain block and things can be just fine but another block, that one special block if removed causes everything else to fall apart. The reality is you have no idea what thing or what block will change your future so everything has a say in it.


For example you watching this video will take up about 10 minutes of your day, whether it’s for a good reason or not. Could be watching a movie or listening to a song, getting a video idea from it , researching it, writing it, editing it and uploading it to where you see it on your YouTube feed, at a specific time prevent something bad from happening to you. Maybe you watching this video prevented you from going to the store 10 minutes early. Where if you had left 10 minutes ago a car that runs the red light would smash into you in an intersection killing you. It’s a scary thought but it’s a possibility. Someone recently messaged me and said that they had saw someone watching one of my videos in their classroom right next to them. They started to talk become friends and now they’re dating. If YouTube was on a platform if I hadn’t had that specific video idea that wouldn’t have happened, and maybe those two people would have never met. But it goes much further than that, everything has led you and I to this very moment literally everything. Because the universe exists , because the universe is expanding, and because the temperature of the universe was just right to the point that in stellar nurseries can form stars, without those stars we wouldn’t have supernovas, without supernovas we wouldn’t have iron, without iron we couldn’t exist.


Every day you breathe I hope and when you exhale you exhale Carbon Dioxide. This Carbon Dioxide through the help of plants and photosynthesis creates more oxygen. Oxygen that people hundreds of years from now might breathe. Everything you do, no matter how small it is will change the future in one way or another. People who lived hundreds of years ago have had an effect on the world as it is today. The things you do today will ripple throughout time. The small things you create today can be the big things that the next generation builds upon, in a way you can live forever. So the next time something big happens in your life, just think it didn’t happen by accident.


Just as the Butterfly Effect suggests everything you do today will change your future drastically. Skills you learned today could come in handy in ways you could never expect 10 years from now. Just like the fractals we talked about one small random action can have serious implications down the road.

          The immune system is a network of biological processes that protects an organism from diseases. It detects and responds to a wide variety of pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, as well as cancer cells and objects such as wood splinters, distinguishing them from the organism’s own healthy tissue. Many species have two major subsystems of the immune system. The innate immune system provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli. The adaptive immune system provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered. Both use molecules and cells to perform their functions.
Nearly all organisms have some kind of immune system. Bacteria have a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against virus infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient plants and animals and remain in their modern descendants. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt to recognize pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.
The immune system protects its host from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. Physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.

We live in a world filled with bacteria, viruses, and other deadly pathogens. In fact, many of them are trying to invade your body right now. If this thought makes you nervous, feel reassured that your body has its own Department of Defense - your immune system. This network works hard round the clock to protect you from harmful invaders. When a pathogen launches an attack, your immune system organizes a beautifully coordinated counter-attack to destroy the pathogen and keep you healthy. Unfortunately, your immune system can make mistakes, including: not destroying diseased or harmful cells (infections and cancer), reacting to non-harmful substances (allergies), or going rogue and attacking your own cells (autoimmune diseases). The immune system is fascinating and complex, and we want to share with you what’s going on in the field of immunology.

When a virus enters your body, it will attach itself to one of your cells and inject its DNA or RNA into it. This is like a blueprint for your cells: containing instructions on what the cell has to make. So, in this case, the virus’s RNA will tell your cell to make more copies of the same virus. They become virus factories, pumping out new copies of the virus that can infect even more cells. Naturally, our bodies have a defense system for foreign intruders. The immune system attacks any protein, virus, or bacteria that do not belong in our bodies. But it takes a few days for it to learn how to attack the intruder. Meanwhile, the virus factories are running non-stop, quickly replicating the virus and spreading it in your body. In other words: you start experiencing symptoms of whatever has infected you.


After a few days, however, your immune system has figured out how to attack the virus and will start to produce antibodies. These attach themselves to the virus, preventing them from infecting more cells and marking them for destruction. As you can see, the immune system is remarkable, but it’s also slow to mount an attack. That’s the reason why we get sick in the first place. So to give it a helping hand, we developed vaccines. The main idea is to train your immune system to recognize and fight off an infection before it has occurred. Almost like showing your immune system a mug shot of the virus and saying: “if you see this, kill it.” There are various types of vaccines, but let’s take a look at mRNA vaccines, the new kid on the block.


To understand how they work, let’s take the COVID19 pandemic as an example. You might have seen pictures of the virus, with its distinctive spikes. These spikes allow the virus to attach to specific cells in your body (ACE2) and infect them. Now here’s the key idea for the COVID19 vaccine: what if we could train our immune system to recognize these spikes by having our body produce them? To do that, researchers took the virus’s blueprint, its RNA, and isolated the part responsible for producing the spikes. Armed with this blueprint, they created mRNA or messenger RNA. This is a special form of RNA that can enter your cells and give them instructions. In this case, the RNA contains instructions to build the spikes of the coronavirus, not the virus itself, just the spikes. So mRNA vaccines contain instructions for your cells that tell them to build a part of a virus in large volumes, almost like giving them a recipe to follow.


Once this is happening, your immune system kicks into action and start learning how to attack these intruders. Again, it takes time for the immune system to fight off these spikes, but you won’t get sick because it’s only the spikes, not the virus itself. And that’s it! Your immune system has learned how to attack the spikes of the coronavirus. It destroys all the spikes and even breaks down the mRNA vaccine itself. The only thing left in your body are special “B cells” or memory cells. These can linger around for months or years until the same virus infects you again. When that happens, the B cell can produce the correct antibodies right away, preventing the virus from spreading and making you sick.


What’s interesting about this mRNA technique is that it’s relatively quick to develop a vaccine as soon as we know the DNA or RNA sequence of a virus. And secondly, because the vaccine only makes our body produce a part of a virus, we can’t get sick. More traditional vaccines use weakened versions of the actual virus. This also triggers an immune response but could also give you mild symptoms. Now you know how mRNA vaccines work, what about their safety? The biggest misunderstanding about this technology is that the mRNA in the vaccine can enter our cells and changes our very own DNA. But that’s not true. mRNA is very fragile and only survives a few hours in our bodies.

          The respiratory system is the organs and other parts of your body involved in breathing,when you exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Parts of the Respiratory System
Nose and nasal cavity
Sinuses
Mouth
Throat (pharynx)
Voice box (larynx)
Windpipe (trachea)
Diaphragm
Lungs
Bronchial tubes&#x2F;bronchi
Bronchioles
Air sacs (alveoli)
Capillaries

How Do We Breathe?Breathing starts when you inhale air into your nose or mouth.It travels down the back of your throat and into your windpipe,which is divided into air passages called bronchial tubes.
For your lungs to perform their best, these airways need to be open.They should be free from inflammation or swelling and extra mucus.
As the bronchial tubes pass through your lungs,they divide into smaller air passages called bronchioles.The bronchioles end in tiny balloon-like air sacs called alveoli.Your body has about 600 million alveoli.
The alveoli are surrounded by a mesh of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.Here, oxygen from inhaled air passes into your blood.
After absorbing oxygen, blood goes to your heart.Your heart then pumps it through your body to the cells of your tissues and organs.
As the cells use the oxygen, they make carbon dioxide that goes into your blood.Your blood then carries the carbon dioxide back to your lungs,where it’s removed from your body when you exhale.
当您将空气吸入鼻子或嘴中时，呼吸开始。
它沿着您的喉咙后部行进，进入您的气管，气管分为称为支气管的空气通道。
为了使您的肺部表现最佳，这些呼吸道需要打开。
他们应该没有发炎或肿胀和多余的黏液。
当支气管穿过肺部时，它们会分成较小的空气通道，称为细支气管。
细支气管终止于称为肺泡的微小气球状气囊。您的身体有大约6亿个肺泡。
肺泡被称为毛细血管的细小血管网包围。在这里，吸入空气中的氧气进入您的血液。
吸收氧气后，血液流到您的心脏。然后，心脏将其通过身体泵送到组织和器官的细胞。

<p>A <strong>photonic quantum</strong> computer could have huge advantages over its matter-based counterpart. Photons are much less prone to interact with their environment, which means they can retain their quantum state for much longer and over long distances. A photonic quantum computer could, in theory, operate at room temperature – and as a result, scale up much faster.</p>
<p>Of the various approaches to quantum computing, photons are appealing for their low-noise properties and ease of manipulation at the single photon level; while the challenge of entangling interactions between photons can be met via measurement induced non-linearities.</p>

          Chinese people believe that we are surrounded by five energy fields or five different kinds of “Qì” (气). These are also called the “five elements” and they play an important role in all aspects of Chinese culture, including the way people eat. This theory states that if these five elements are changed or moved, this could seriously affect a person’s fate.
The “five elements” (五行) are also known as the five agents, five phases, five movements, five forces, five processes, and five planets.
If the concept of yīn and yáng is the center of the Chinese culture, then the theory of the “five elements” should be treated as its cornerstone.

The Five Elements TheoryThe five elements are metal (金), wood (木), water (水), fire (火), and earth (土). Chinese people use this five elements theory for a lot of things, from the interaction between internal organs to politics, and Chinese medicine to cooking and food.
It’s just like finding the perfect balance yīn and yáng, it’s about trying to find the perfect balance between the five elements. There are two main relationships between these five elements. One is called “mutual generation (相生)” and the other one is called “mutual overcoming (相克).”
Examples of mutual generating:

Wood made Fire stronger.
Fire made Earth (ash).
Earth contained and bore Metal.
Metal improved the quality of the Water.
Water helps the Wood grow.

Example of mutual overcoming:

Earth can stop Water.
Water can stop a Fire.
Fire can melt Metal.
Metal can cut Wood.
Wood can consume Earth.

To give an example from nature, a plant (wood) grows when it is given water. When burnt, wood gives birth to fire, and the burnt ashes subsequently return to the earth.

          Maximum Normal Stress CriterionThe maximum stress criterion, also known as the normal stress, Coulomb, or Rankine criterion, is often used to predict the failure of brittle materials.The maximum stress criterion states that failure occurs when the maximum (normal) principal stress reaches either the uniaxial tension strength st, or the uniaxial compression strength sc,
$$-s_{c}&lt;\left{s_{1}, s_{2}\right}&lt;s_{t}$$
where $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are the principal stresses for 2D stress.
Graphically, the maximum stress criterion requires that the two principal stresses lie within the green zone depicted below,

Mohr’s TheoryThe Mohr Theory of Failure, also known as the Coulomb-Mohr criterion or internal-friction theory, is based on the famous Mohr’s Circle. Mohr’s theory is often used in predicting the failure of brittle materials, and is applied to cases of 2D stress.
Mohr’s theory suggests that failure occurs when Mohr’s Circle at a point in the body exceeds the envelope created by the two Mohr’s circles for uniaxial tensile strength and uniaxial compression strength. This envelope is shown in the figure below,

The left circle is for uniaxial compression at the limiting compression stress sc of the material. Likewise, the right circle is for uniaxial tension at the limiting tension stress st.
The middle Mohr’s Circle on the figure (dash-dot-dash line) represents the maximum allowable stress for an intermediate stress state.
All intermediate stress states fall into one of the four categories in the following table. Each case defines the maximum allowable values for the two principal stresses to avoid failure.

Graphically, Mohr’s theory requires that the two principal stresses lie within the green zone depicted below,

Also shown on the figure is the maximum stress criterion (dashed line). This theory is less conservative than Mohr’s theory since it lies outside Mohr’s boundary.

We know that when we apply loads to an object, like this bracket, if we keep increasing the magnitude of the load, at some point the material will fail. But how can we predict when static failure will occur? What level do the stresses in the object need to reach for it to fail? First we need to define what failure is. For ductile materials failure is usually considered to occur at the onset of plastic deformation. And for brittle materials it occurs at fracture. These points are easy to define for a uniaxial stress state, like a tensile test. They occur when the normal stress in the object reaches the yield strength of the material for ductile materials and the ultimate strength for brittle materials.


But for a more complex case of tri-axial stress, predicting failure is much less straightforward. In fact it’s so difficult to predict that we don’t have one universally applicable method. Instead, we have to predict failure by selecting the most suitable one of a range of different failure theories, each of which we know works relatively well under certain circumstances, based on experimentation. Because they fail in fundamentally different ways, failure theories which apply for ductile materials usually aren’t applicable for brittle materials, and vice-versa. So what does a failure theory do? It’s quite simple - it allows us to predict failure of a material by comparing the stress state in the object we are assessing with material properties that are easy to determine, like the yield or ultimate strengths of the material, that we can obtain by performing a uniaxial test.


The stress state at a point can be described using the three principal stresses, so most failure theories are defined as a function of the principal stresses and the material strength. Probably the simplest failure theory is to say that failure occurs when the maximum or minimum principal stresses reach the yield or ultimate strengths of the material. This is called Maximum Principal Stress theory, or Rankine theory. Although it’s simple to apply, it’s not actually a great failure theory, particularly for ductile materials, for reasons I’ll explain later. Let’s look at some better failure theories for ductile materials. Any good failure theory needs to be consistent with experimental observations we can make about how materials fail.


There is one key observation that failure theories for ductile materials need to capture, which is the fact that hydrostatic stresses do not cause yielding in ductile materials. Let me explain. A general tri-axial stress state like the one shown here can be decomposed into stresses which cause a change in volume, and stresses which cause shape distortion. Stresses that cause a change in volume are called hydrostatic stresses, because that is the type of stress acting on an object submerged in liquid.


For a hydrostatic stress configuration the three principal stresses are always equal, and there are no shear stresses. For a tri-axial stress state we can calculate the hydrostatic component as the average of the three principal stresses. The mechanism that causes yielding of ductile materials is shear deformation. Since there are no shear stresses for a state of hydrostatic stress, this component can be very large and still not contribute to yielding. Yielding is only caused by the stresses which cause shape distortion. These are called deviatoric stresses. The deviatoric component is calculated by subtracting the hydrostatic component from each of the principal stresses. The hydrostatic and deviatoric components can be expressed in matrix form, like this. Here we have described the stress state using the principal stresses, but we could also describe it for an arbitrary orientation of the stress element.


It can be helpful to use Mohr’s circle to understand the hydrostatic and deviatoric components of a tri-axial stress state. For a hydrostatic stress configuration there are no shear stresses, and so Mohr’s circle reduces to a single point, equal to the average of the three principal stresses. Shifting Mohr’s circle horizontally represents an increase in the hydrostatic component. And increasing the radius of Mohr’s circle without changing the average stress represents an increase in the deviatoric component. Since failure of ductile materials only depends on the deviatoric component, a good failure theory for ductile materials should produce the same result regardless of where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. This explains why Maximum Principal Stress theory is not a good failure theory for ductile materials - it isn’t consistent with the observation that yielding is independent of hydrostatic stress. Two failure theories which are consistent with this observation are the Tresca and von Mises failure criteria. These are the two most commonly used failure theories for ductile materials.


Let’s start with the Tresca failure criterion, which is also called the maximum shear stress theory. It is named after the French engineer Henri Tresca, and it states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress is equal to the shear stress at yielding in a tensile test. This can be defined mathematically, like this. And graphically using Mohr’s circle, like this. This theory is consistent with the observation that hydrostatic stresses don’t affect yield. It doesn’t care where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. It’s common to express this theory as a function of the principal stresses, instead of as a function of the shear stresses. We can see based on Mohr’s circle for a tri-axial stress state that the maximum shear stress is equal to the radius of the outer circle, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses, divided by 2. Mohr’s circle for a uniaxial tensile test at yielding looks like this. The intermediate and minimum principal stresses 𝞼₂ and 𝞼₃ are equal to zero, and the maximum principal stress 𝞼₁ is equal to the yield strength of the material. The shear stress at yielding is equal to half of the yield strength of the material, so we can re-write our equation to obtain the standard formulation for the Tresca theory.



Let’s look at the von Mises failure criterion next, which is also called the maximum distortion energy theory. It was initially developed by the Austrian scientist Richard von Mises, but a number of others were involved in refining it, so it is sometimes called the Maxwell–Huber–Hencky–von Mises theory. It states that yielding occurs when the maximum distortion energy in a material is equal to the distortion energy at yielding in a uniaxial tensile test.


So what is the distortion energy? It is essentially the portion of strain energy in a stressed element corresponding to the effect of the deviatoric stresses. The distortion energy per unit volume can be calculated from the principal stresses using this equation. We know that at yielding during a tensile test the maximum principal stress is equal to the yield strength of the material, and the two other principal stresses are equal to zero. So we can calculate the distortion energy at yielding in a tensile test by plugging in the appropriate principal stress values.


And by equating the distortion energy at yielding with the general equation for a tri-axial stress state, and re-arranging a bit, we get an equation that defines the von Mises failure criterion. Again we can see that this theory considers the difference between principal stresses, and so is independent of the hydrostatic stress. The term on the left is often called the equivalent von Mises stress. If it is larger than the yield strength of the material, yielding is predicted to have occurred.


The equivalent von Mises stress is a common output from stress analysis performed using the finite element method. Contour plots are typically generated to show the distribution of the von Mises equivalent stress within a component, as these allow areas at risk of yielding to be identified. When comparing failure theories it can be useful to plot their yield surfaces. A yield surface is the representation of a failure theory in the principal stress space, which sounds more complicated than it actually is. To keep things simple let’s start by considering a plane stress case, where one of the three principal stresses is equal to zero. By convention principal stresses are ordered from largest to smallest, like this, but since we don’t know yet how the stresses will be ordered, I’ll refer to them as 𝞼A, 𝞼B, and 𝞼C instead. We’ll say that 𝞼C is equal to zero, and so the two axes of our yield surface graph correspond to the two non-zero principal stresses, 𝞼A and 𝞼B.


The yield surface for the Maximum Principal Stress theory is easy to plot - it says that yielding begins when either of these principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material, so it looks like this. Yielding is considered to have occurred when the stress state reaches this line. Next let’s plot the yield surface for the Tresca theory. This theory states that yielding occurs when the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material. But it’s not as simple as taking the difference between 𝞼A and 𝞼B. Plane stress is still a three-dimensional stress state. In the top right quadrant of the graph both 𝞼A and 𝞼B are positive, and so 𝞼C, which is equal to zero, is the minimum principal stress. The yield surface looks like this. But in the bottom right quadrant 𝞼B is negative, and so 𝞼B is the minimum principal stress. That gives us a yield surface that looks like this.


Repeating this process for the other two quadrants completes the Tresca yield surface. von Mises yield theory for plane stress conditions is defined using this equation when expressed in terms of the principal stresses. We can square both sides of the equation and see that it is of the same form as an ellipse, which gives us the von Mises yield surface. Let’s plot some experimental data for tests performed on ductile materials and see how each of these theories compares. It’s clear that the Maximum Principal Stress theory has large areas where its use is potentially unsafe. So let’s get rid of it, and compare Tresca and von Mises. Both agree well with experimental observations, although von Mises agrees slightly better. The Tresca yield surface lies entirely inside the von Mises surface, meaning that Tresca is more conservative.


If we assume that the principal stresses will increase in proportion to one another as a load is applied, and so the stress paths are straight lines, the difference between the Tresca and von Mises theories is largest for these three configurations. The maximum difference between the two theories can be calculated to be 15.5%. von Mises is usually preferred to Tresca because it agrees better with experimental data, but Tresca is sometimes used because it is easier to apply and it is more conservative. So far we have looked at a plane stress case, with 𝞼C equal to zero. But for a general three-dimensional stress state, 𝞼C will be non-zero. We know that the Tresca and von Mises yield surfaces aren’t affected by hydrostatic stresses, and so to obtain the yield surfaces in three dimensions we just need to extend the plane stress yield surfaces along the hydrostatic axis.


Failure of brittle materials is different to failure of ductile materials. For brittle materials, failure is considered to occur by fracture rather than yielding. And unlike ductile materials, brittle materials tend to have compressive strengths that are much larger than their tensile strengths. This needs to be captured in any failure theory for brittle materials. It also means that to assess failure of brittle materials we need to know two separate ultimate strengths, for tension and for compression.


Coulomb-Mohr theory is a failure theory often used for brittle materials. Unlike the theories we have seen for ductile materials, it considers failure to be sensitive to hydrostatic stresses, and captures the difference between tensile and compressive ultimate strengths. The easiest way to define this theory is using Mohr’s circle. We start by drawing the Mohr’s circles corresponding to failure in the uniaxial tensile and compressive tests. By drawing lines tangent to both circles we create a failure envelope.


Coulomb-Mohr theory states that a material will fail for a stress-state with a Mohr’s circle that reaches this envelope. The Tresca yield criterion we saw earlier is actually a special case of the Coulomb-Mohr failure theory, where we have the same material properties in tension and in compression. The plane stress failure surface for Coulomb-Mohr theory looks like this.



As you can see it doesn’t agree particularly well with experimental data in the bottom right quadrant. Modified Mohr theory is a slight variation on the theory, which better fits experimental data. It is one of the preferred general failure theories for brittle materials. Because failure theories for brittle materials need to account for the effect of hydrostatic stresses, these failure theories converge to a point when extended along the hydrostatic axis. And that’s it for this introduction to failure theories! We’ve covered the most common theories, but there are many more out there which may be more appropriate for specific scenarios.

          Riemann hypothesis, in number theory, hypothesis by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann concerning the location of solutions to the Riemann zeta function, which is connected to the prime number theorem and has important implications for the distribution of prime numbers. Riemann included the hypothesis in a paper, “Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse” (“On the Number of Prime Numbers Less Than a Given Quantity”), published in the November 1859 edition of Monatsberichte der Berliner Akademie (“Monthly Review of the Berlin Academy”).


Other than the “trivial zeros” along the negative real axis,
all the solutions to the Riemann zeta function must lie in the critical strip of complex numbers whose 
real part is between 0 and 1. The Riemann hypothesis is that all these nontrivial zeros actually lie on 
the critical line, or $Re(S) &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$.

The zeta function is defined as the infinite series
$$\zeta(s)&#x3D;1+2^{-s}+3^{-s}+4^{-s}+\cdots$$
or, in more compact notation,
$$\zeta(s)&#x3D;\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}}$$
where the summation $(Σ)$ of terms for n runs from 1 to infinity through the positive integers and s is a fixed positive integer greater than 1. The zeta function was first studied by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. (For this reason, it is sometimes called the Euler zeta function. For $ζ(1)$, this series is simply the harmonic series, known since antiquity to increase without bound — i.e., its sum is infinite.) 
Euler achieved instant fame when he proved in 1735 that $ζ(2) &#x3D; π^{2}&#x2F;6$, a problem that had eluded the greatest mathematicians of the era, including the Swiss Bernoulli family (Jakob, Johann, and Daniel). More generally, Euler discovered (1739) a relation between the value of the zeta function for even integers and the Bernoulli numbers, which are the coefficients in the Taylor series expansion of $x&#x2F;(e^{x} − 1)$. (See also exponential function.) Still more amazing, in 1737 Euler discovered a formula relating the zeta function, which involves summing an infinite sequence of terms containing the positive integers, and an infinite product that involves every prime number:
$$\zeta(s)&#x3D;\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}}&#x3D;\prod_{p} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$
Riemann extended the study of the zeta function to include the complex numbers $x + iy$, where $i &#x3D; \sqrt{−1}$, except for the line $x &#x3D; 1$ in the complex plane. Riemann knew that the zeta function equals zero for all negative even integers −2, −4, −6, … (so-called trivial zeros) and that it has an infinite number of zeros in the critical strip of complex numbers that fall strictly between the lines $x &#x3D; 0$ and $x &#x3D; 1$. He also knew that all nontrivial zeros are symmetric with respect to the critical line $x &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$. Riemann conjectured that all of the nontrivial zeros are on the critical line, a conjecture that subsequently became known as the Riemann hypothesis.
In 1914 English mathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy proved that an infinite number of solutions of $ζ(s) &#x3D; 0$ exist on the critical line $x &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$. Subsequently it was shown by various mathematicians that a large proportion of the solutions must lie on the critical line, though the frequent “proofs” that all the nontrivial solutions are on it have been flawed. Computers have also been used to test solutions, with the first 10 trillion nontrivial solutions shown to lie on the critical line.
A proof of the Riemann hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography.
The Riemann hypothesis has long been considered the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics. It was one of 10 unsolved mathematical problems (23 in the printed address) presented as a challenge for 20th-century mathematicians by German mathematician David Hilbert at the Second International Congress of Mathematics in Paris on Aug. 8, 1900.
In 2000 American mathematician Stephen Smale updated Hilbert’s idea with a list of important problems for the 21st century; the Riemann hypothesis was number one.In 2000 it was designated a Millennium Problem, one of seven mathematical problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., U.S., for a special award. The solution for each Millennium Problem is worth $1 million.In 2008 the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) listed it as one of the DARPA Mathematical Challenges, 23 mathematical problems for which it was soliciting research proposals for funding — “Mathematical Challenge Nineteen: Settle the Riemann Hypothesis.

          DivergenceDivergence is an operation on a vector field that tells us how the field behaves toward or away from a point. Locally, the divergence of a vector field $\vec{F}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ at a particular point $P$ is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of the vector field at $P$.If $\vec{F}$ represents the velocity of a fluid, then the divergence of $\vec{F}$ at $P$ measures the net rate of change with respect to time of the amount of fluid flowing away from $P$ (the tendency of the fluid to flow “out of” P). In particular, if the amount of fluid flowing into $P$ is the same as the amount flowing out, then the divergence at $P$ is zero.
Definition: divergence in $\mathbb{R}^3$If $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q,R \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $P_x, , Q_y,$ and $R_z$ all exist, then the divergence of $\vec{F}$ is defined by
$$\begin{aligned}\operatorname{div} F &amp;&#x3D;P_{x}+Q_{y}+R_{z} \&amp;&#x3D;\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial R}{\partial z}\end{aligned}$$
Note the divergence of a vector field is not a vector field, but a scalar function. In terms of the gradient operator
$$\vec{\nabla}&#x3D;\left\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right\rangle$$
divergence can be written symbolically as the dot product
$$\operatorname{div} \vec{F}&#x3D;\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{F}.$$
Note this is merely helpful notation, because the dot product of a vector of operators and a vector of functions is not meaningfully defined given our current definition of dot product.
If $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , and $P_{x}$ and $Q_{y}$ both exist, then the divergence of $\vec{F}$ is defined similarly as
$$\begin{aligned}\operatorname{div} \vec{F} &amp;&#x3D;P_{x}+Q_{y} \&amp;&#x3D;\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y} \&amp;&#x3D;\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{F}\end{aligned}.$$
To illustrate this point, consider the two vector fields in Figure 1. At any particular point, the amount flowing in is the same as the amount flowing out, so at every point the “outflowing-ness” of the field is zero. Therefore, we expect the divergence of both fields to be zero, and this is indeed the case, as
$$\text{div}(\langle 1,2 \rangle ) &#x3D; \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (1) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}(2) &#x3D; 0$$
and
$$\text{div}(\langle -y,x \rangle ) &#x3D; \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (-y) + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (x) &#x3D; 0.$$


Figure 1: (a) Vector field ⟨1, 2⟩ has zero divergence. (b) Vector field ⟨−𝑦, 𝑥⟩ also has zero divergence.

By contrast, consider radial vector field $\vec{R}(x, y)&#x3D;\langle-x,-y\rangle$ in Figure 2. At any given point, more fluid is flowing in than is flowing out, and therefore the “outgoingness” of the field is negative. We expect the divergence of this field to be negative, and this is indeed the case, as
$$\operatorname{div}(\vec{R})&#x3D;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(-x)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(-y)&#x3D;-2$$


Figure 2: This vector field has negative divergence.

To get a global sense of what divergence is telling us, suppose that a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^2$ represents the velocity of a fluid. Imagine taking an elastic circle (a circle with a shape that can be changed by the vector field) and dropping it into a fluid. If the circle maintains its exact area as it flows through the fluid, then the divergence is zero. This would occur for both vector fields in Figure 1. On the other hand, if the circle’s shape is distorted so that its area shrinks or expands, then the divergence is not zero. Imagine dropping such an elastic circle into the radial vector field in Figure 2 so that the center of the circle lands at point (3, 3). The circle would flow toward the origin, and as it did so the front of the circle would travel more slowly than the back, causing the circle to “scrunch” and lose area. This is how you can see a negative divergence.
CurlThe second operation on a vector field that we examine is the curl, which measures the extent of rotation of the field about a point. Suppose that $\vec{F}$ represents the velocity field of a fluid. Then, the curl of $\vec{F}$ at point $P$ is a vector that measures the tendency of particles near $P$ to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of this vector. The magnitude of the curl vector at $P$ measures how quickly the particles rotate around this axis. In other words, the curl at a point is a measure of the vector field’s “spin” at that point. Visually, imagine placing a paddlewheel into a fluid at $P$ , with the axis of the paddlewheel aligned with the curl vector (Figure 3). The curl measures the tendency of the paddlewheel to rotate.


Figure 3: To visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a small paddlewheel into the vector field at a point.

Consider the vector fields in Figure 1. In part (a), the vector field is constant and there is no spin at any point. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be zero, and this is indeed the case. Part (b) shows a rotational field, so the field has spin. In particular, if you place a paddlewheel into a field at any point so that the axis of the wheel is perpendicular to a plane, the wheel rotates counterclockwise. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be nonzero, and this is indeed the case (the curl is $2,\mathbf{\hat k}$).
To see what curl is measuring globally, imagine dropping a leaf into the fluid. As the leaf moves along with the fluid flow, the curl measures the tendency of the leaf to rotate. If the curl is zero, then the leaf doesn’t rotate as it moves through the fluid.
Definition: CurlIf $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q,R \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $P_x, , Q_y,$ and $R_z$ all exist, then the curl of $\vec{F}$ is defined by
$$\begin{aligned}\operatorname{curl} \vec{F} &amp;&#x3D;\left(\boldsymbol{R}{y}-Q{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\left(\boldsymbol{P}{z}-\boldsymbol{R}{x}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(Q_{x}-\boldsymbol{P}_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}} \&amp;&#x3D;\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{R}}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{R}}{\partial x}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}\end{aligned}$$
Note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field, in contrast to divergence.
The definition of curl can be difficult to remember. To help with remembering, we use the notation $\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{F}$ to stand for a “determinant” that gives the curl formula:
$$\left|\begin{array}{ccc}\hat{i} &amp; \hat{j} &amp; \hat{k} \\frac{\partial}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \P &amp; Q &amp; R\end{array}\right|.$$
The determinant of this matrix is
$$\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}-\left(R_{x}-P_{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\right) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\left(P_{z}-R_{x}\right) \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\operatorname{curl} \vec{F}.$$
Thus, this matrix is a way to help remember the formula for curl. Keep in mind, though, that the word determinant is used very loosely. A determinant is not really defined on a matrix with entries that are three vectors, three operators, and three functions.
If $\vec{F} &#x3D; \langle P,Q \rangle$ is a vector field in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , then the curl of $\vec{F}$ , by definition, is
$$\operatorname{curl} \vec{F}&#x3D;\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \hat{\mathbf{k}}$$
