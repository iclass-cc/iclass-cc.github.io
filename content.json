In vertebrates, melatonin is involved in synchronizing circadian rhythms, including sleep–wake timing and blood pressure regulation, and in control of seasonal rhythmicity including reproduction, fattening, moulting and hibernation. Many of its effects are through activation of the melatonin receptors, while others are due to its role as an antioxidant. In plants, it functions to defend against oxidative stress. It is also present in various foods. In animals, melatonin plays an important role in the regulation of sleep–wake cycles. Human infants’ melatonin levels become regular in about the third month after birth, with the highest levels measured between midnight and 8:00 am. Human melatonin production decreases as a person ages. Also, as children become teenagers, the nightly schedule of melatonin release is delayed, leading to later sleeping and waking times. Melatonin occurs at high concentrations within mitochondrial fluid which greatly exceed the plasma concentration of melatonin. Due to its capacity for free radical scavenging, indirect effects on the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and its significant concentrations within mitochondria, a number of authors have indicated that melatonin has an important physiological function as a mitochondrial antioxidant. While it is known that melatonin interacts with the immune system, the details of those interactions are unclear. An antiinflammatory effect seems to be the most relevant. There have been few trials designed to judge the effectiveness of melatonin in disease treatment. Most existing data are based on small, incomplete trials. Any positive immunological effect is thought to be the result of melatonin acting on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2) expressed in immunocompetent cells. In preclinical studies, melatonin may enhance cytokine production, and by doing this, counteract acquired immunodeficiences. Some studies also suggest that melatonin might be useful fighting infectious disease including viral, such as HIV, and bacterial infections, and potentially in the treatment of cancer.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Chemical 化学","slug":"Chemical-化学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Chemical-%E5%8C%96%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Civil Aviation 民航","slug":"2022-04-11-06-27-civil-aviation","date":"2022-04-10T22:27:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-21T10:33:11.144Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/11/2022-04-11-06-27-civil-aviation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/04/11/2022-04-11-06-27-civil-aviation/","excerpt":"Civil aviation is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-military and non-state aviation, both private and commercial.

Mass fractionIn aerospace engineering, the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle’s mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle’s performance. In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design. Another related measure is the payload fraction, which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload. Effective exhaust velocityThe effective exhaust velocity is often specified as a specific impulse and they are related to each other by: $$v_{\\mathrm{e}}&#x3D;g_{0} I_{\\mathrm{sp}}$$ where $I_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ is the specific impulse in seconds, $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the specific impulse measured in $m&#x2F;s$, which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in $m&#x2F;s$ (or $ft&#x2F;s$ if g is in $ft&#x2F;s^{2}$), $g_{0}$ is the standard gravity, 9.80665 $m&#x2F;s^{2}$ (in Imperial units 32.174 $ft&#x2F;s^{2}$). Examples Single-stage-to-orbit rocket: $1-e^{-9.7 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.884$, therefore 88.4% of the initial total mass has to be propellant. The remaining 11.6% is for the engines, the tank, and the payload. Two-stage-to-orbit: suppose that the first stage should provide a ${\\Delta v}$ of 5,000 meters per second (16,000 $ft&#x2F;s$); $1-e^{-5.0 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.671$, therefore 67.1% of the initial total mass has to be propellant to the first stage. The remaining mass is 32.9%. After disposing of the first stage, a mass remains equal to this 32.9%, minus the mass of the tank and engines of the first stage. Assume that this is 8% of the initial total mass, then 24.9% remains. The second stage should provide a ${\\Delta v}$ of 4,700 meters per second (15,000 $ft&#x2F;s$); $1-e^{-4.7 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.648$, therefore 64.8% of the remaining mass has to be propellant, which is 16.2% of the original total mass, and 8.7% remains for the tank and engines of the second stage, the payload, and in the case of a space shuttle, also the orbiter. Thus together 16.7% of the original launch mass is available for all engines, the tanks, and payload. StagesIn the case of sequentially thrusting rocket stages, the equation applies for each stage, where for each stage the initial mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket after discarding the previous stage, and the final mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket just before discarding the stage concerned. For each stage the specific impulse may be different. For example, if 80% of the mass of a rocket is the fuel of the first stage, and 10% is the dry mass of the first stage, and 10% is the remaining rocket, then $$\\begin{aligned}\\Delta v &amp;&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln \\frac{100}{100-80} \\&amp;&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln 5 \\&amp;&#x3D;1.61 v_{\\mathrm{e}}\\end{aligned}$$ With three similar, subsequently smaller stages with the same $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ for each stage, we have $$\\Delta v&#x3D;3 v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln 5&#x3D;4.83 v_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ and the payload is 10% × 10% × 10% &#x3D; 0.1% of the initial mass. A comparable SSTO rocket, also with a 0.1% payload, could have a mass of 11.1% for fuel tanks and engines, and 88.8% for fuel. This would give $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln (100 &#x2F; 11.2)&#x3D;2.19 v_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ If the motor of a new stage is ignited before the previous stage has been discarded and the simultaneously working motors have a different specific impulse (as is often the case with solid rocket boosters and a liquid-fuel stage), the situation is more complicated. DerivationsConsider the following system: In the following derivation, “the rocket” is taken to mean “the rocket and all of its unexpended propellant”. Newton’s second law of motion relates external forces ($F_{i}$) to the change in linear momentum of the whole system (including rocket and exhaust) as follows: $$\\sum F_{i}&#x3D;\\lim {\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{P{2}-P_{1}}{\\Delta t}$$ where $P_{1}$ is the momentum of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$ : $$P_{1}&#x3D;(m+\\Delta m) V$$ and $P_{2}$ is the momentum of the rocket and exhausted mass at time $t &#x3D; \\Delta t$ : $$P_{2}&#x3D;m(V+\\Delta V)+\\Delta m V_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ and where, with respect to the observer: $V$ is the velocity of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$ $V+\\Delta V$ is the velocity of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; \\Delta t$ $V_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the velocity of the mass added to the exhaust (and lost by the rocket) during time $\\Delta t$ $m+\\Delta m$ is the mass of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$ $m$ is the mass of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; \\Delta t$ The velocity of the exhaust $V_{\\mathrm{e}}$ in the observer frame is related to the velocity of the exhaust in the rocket frame $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ by (since exhaust velocity is in the negative direction) $$V_{\\mathrm{e}}&#x3D;V-v_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ Solving yields: $$P_{2}-P_{1}&#x3D;m \\Delta V-v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\Delta m$$ and, using $dm &#x3D; - \\Delta m$ , since ejecting a positive $\\Delta m$ results in a decrease in mass in time, $$\\sum F_{i}&#x3D;m \\frac{d V}{d t}+v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{d m}{d t}$$ If there are no external forces then $\\sum F_{i} &#x3D; 0$ (conservation of linear momentum) and $$-m \\frac{d V}{d t}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{d m}{d t}$$ Assuming $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is constant, this may be integrated as follows: $$-\\int_{V}^{V+\\Delta V} \\mathrm{d} V&#x3D;v_{e} \\int_{m_{0}}^{m_{f}} \\frac{1}{m} \\mathrm{d} m$$ This then yields $$\\Delta V&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$ or equivalently $$m_{f}&#x3D;m_{0} e^{-\\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$ or $$m_{0}&#x3D;m_{f} e^{\\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$ or $$m_{0}-m_{f}&#x3D;m_{f}\\left(e^{\\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\\mathrm{e}}}-1\\right)$$ where $m_{0}$ is the initial total mass including propellant, $m_{f}$ the final mass, and $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ the velocity of the rocket exhaust with respect to the rocket (the specific impulse, or, if measured in time, that multiplied by gravity-on-Earth acceleration). The value $m_{0} - m_{f}$ is the total working mass of propellant expended. $\\Delta V$ is the integration over time of the magnitude of the acceleration produced by using the rocket engine (what would be the actual acceleration if external forces were absent). In free space, for the case of acceleration in the direction of the velocity, this is the increase of the speed. In the case of an acceleration in opposite direction (deceleration) it is the decrease of the speed. Of course gravity and drag also accelerate the vehicle, and they can add or subtract to the change in velocity experienced by the vehicle. Hence delta-v may not always be the actual change in speed or velocity of the vehicle. Impulse-basedThe equation can also be derived from the basic integral of acceleration in the form of force (thrust) over mass. By representing the delta-v equation as the following: $$\\Delta v&#x3D;\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} \\frac{|T|}{m_{0}-t \\Delta m} d t$$ where $T$ is thrust, $m_{0}$ is the initial (wet) mass and $\\Delta m$ is the initial mass minus the final (dry) mass, and realising that the integral of a resultant force over time is total impulse, assuming thrust is the only force involved, $$\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} F d t&#x3D;J$$ The integral is found to be: $$J \\frac{\\ln \\left(m_{0}\\right)-\\ln \\left(m_{f}\\right)}{\\Delta m}$$ Realising that impulse over the change in mass is equivalent to force over propellant mass flow rate (p), which is itself equivalent to exhaust velocity, $$\\frac{J}{\\Delta m}&#x3D;\\frac{F}{p}&#x3D;V_{\\mathrm{exh}}$$ the integral can be equated to $$\\Delta v&#x3D;V_{\\mathrm{exh}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}\\right)$$ Acceleration-basedImagine a rocket at rest in space with no forces exerted on it (Newton’s First Law of Motion). From the moment its engine is started (clock set to 0) the rocket expels gas mass at a constant mass flow rate $R$ ($kg&#x2F;s$) and at exhaust velocity relative to the rocket $v_{e}$ ($m&#x2F;s$). This creates a constant force $F$ propelling the rocket that is equal to $R \\times v_{e}$. The rocket is subject to a constant force, but its total mass is decreasing steadily because it is expelling gas. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, its acceleration at any time $t$ is its propelling force $F$ divided by its current mass $m$: $$a&#x3D;\\frac{d v}{d t}&#x3D;-\\frac{F}{m(t)}&#x3D;-\\frac{R v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{m(t)}$$ Now, the mass of fuel the rocket initially has on board is equal to $m_{0} – m_{f}$. For the constant mass flow rate $R$ it will therefore take a time $T &#x3D; (m_{0} – m_{f})&#x2F;R$ to burn all this fuel. Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to time from $0$ to $T$ (and noting that $R &#x3D; dm&#x2F;dt$ allows a substitution on the right), we obtain $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{f}-v_{0}&#x3D;-v_{\\mathrm{e}}\\left[\\ln m_{f}-\\ln m_{0}\\right]&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}\\right)$$ Limit of finite mass “pellet” expulsionThe rocket equation can also be derived as the limiting case of the speed change for a rocket that expels its fuel in the form of $N$ pellets consecutively, as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, with an effective exhaust speed $v_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ such that the mechanical energy gained per unit fuel mass is given by $\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}$ . In the rocket’s center-of-mass frame, if a pellet of mass $m_{p}$ is ejected at speed $u$ and the remaining mass of the rocket is $m$ , the amount of energy converted to increase the rocket’s and pellet’s kinetic energy is $$\\frac{1}{2} m_{p} v_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}&#x3D;\\frac{1}{2} m_{p} u^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m(\\Delta v)^{2}$$ Using momentum conservation in the rocket’s frame just prior to ejection, $u&#x3D;\\Delta v \\frac{m}{m_{p}}$ , from which we find $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{m p}{\\sqrt{m\\left(m+m_{p}\\right)}}$$ Let $\\phi$ be the initial fuel mass fraction on board and $m_{0}$ the initial fueled-up mass of the rocket. Divide the total mass of fuel $\\phi m_{0}$ into $N$ discrete pellets each of mass $m_{p} &#x3D; \\phi m_{0} &#x2F; N$ . The remaining mass of the rocket after ejecting $j$ pellets is then $m&#x3D;m_{0}(1-j\\phi &#x2F;N)$. The overall speed change after ejecting $j$ pellets is the sum $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \\frac{\\phi &#x2F; N}{\\sqrt{(1-j \\phi &#x2F; N)(1-j \\phi &#x2F; N+\\phi &#x2F; N)}}$$ Notice that for large $N$ the last term in the denominator $\\phi &#x2F; N \\ll 1$ and can be neglected to give $$\\Delta v \\approx v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \\frac{\\phi &#x2F; N}{1-j \\phi &#x2F; N}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \\frac{\\Delta x}{1-x_{j}} \\text { where } \\Delta x&#x3D;\\frac{\\phi}{N} \\text { and } x_{j}&#x3D;\\frac{j \\phi}{N}$$ As $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ this Riemann sum becomes the definite integral $$\\lim {N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\Delta v&#x3D;v{\\mathrm{eff}} \\int_{0}^{\\phi} \\frac{d x}{1-x}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln \\frac{1}{1-\\phi}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$ since the final remaining mass of the rocket is $m_{f}&#x3D;m_{0}(1-\\phi)$ . Special relativityIf special relativity is taken into account, the following equation can be derived for a relativistic rocket, with $\\Delta v$ again standing for the rocket’s final velocity (after expelling all its reaction mass and being reduced to a rest mass of $m_{1}$) in the inertial frame of reference where the rocket started at rest (with the rest mass including fuel being $m_{0}$) , and $c$ standing for the speed of light in a vacuum: $$\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}&#x3D;\\left[\\frac{1+\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}}{1-\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}}\\right]^{\\frac{c}{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}}$$ Writing $\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}$ as $R$ allows this equation to be rearranged as $$\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}&#x3D;\\frac{R^{\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c}}-1}{R^{\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c}}+1}$$ Then, using the identity $$R^{\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c}}&#x3D;\\exp \\left[\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c} \\ln R\\right]$$ (here “$\\exp$” denotes the exponential function; see also Natural logarithm as well as the “power” identity at Logarithmic identities) and the identity $\\tanh x&#x3D;\\frac{e^{2 x}-1}{e^{2 x}+1}$ (see Hyperbolic function), this is equivalent to $$\\Delta v&#x3D;c \\tanh \\left(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}\\right)$$","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Ai 人工智能","slug":"2022-03-06-10-38-ai","date":"2022-03-06T02:38:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.374Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/03/06/2022-03-06-10-38-ai/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/03/06/2022-03-06-10-38-ai/","excerpt":"Artificial super intelligence is humanity’s last invention, no reason to be scared.Let’s take a journey into the future and explore how Ai developsand changes humanity paving the way for robots that are too fastfor humans to see in 10 years time, for the creation of Ai-free zones in 60 years.For energy being rationed for humans to power the super AIs in 90 years,and for human consciousness to be transmitted into space as data in 200 years time. 2028People are having natural conversations with artificial intelligence.Google’s lambda allows humans to talk to expert AIs on any topic starting to replace the need for online searches.Elon Musk’s Neurolink graduates from being a medical device and testing begins on increasing human intelligence.This gets the name IA (Intelligence Amplification) peripherals physical add-ons are being developed,such as zoom cameras sonar based night vision and taste modifiers that can all be connected to the brain chip. 2030Loved ones who have passed away are being turned into digital avatars.These Ai chat bots patented by Microsoft learn how to respond by studying the text audioand video conversations from when the human was alive.Ai limbs robotic arm prosthetics start to have artificial intelligence built into them allowing the prostheticsto download new skills, such as how to play different songs on a piano or how to build things.More advanced Ai limbs are being developed that are more self-aware operatingas their own entity they are able to catch a falling glass bottle before the human user is even awarethat it is moved the internet of things begins to evolve into the artificial intelligence of things.Everyday objects such as coffee machines and toothbrushes that collect data,and are connected to the internet now possess Ai.

Video games are being run by Ai assistant directors sensors,and cameras and gaming devices are able to monitor how a human player is feeling at all times a gaming. Ai is able to modify the difficulty and story of a horror game while it is being played so that it makes a human player afraid enough to enjoy it, but not so afraid to stop playing game characters have artificially generated voices and personalities that can generate their own interactions rather than using pre-recorded sound bites. At the U.N. security council world leaders discuss the potential emergence of artificial general intelligence.Coded biases still exist within Ai, the data that the artificial intelligence learns from leans certain ways based on gender race or socioeconomic grouping.The Ai begins thinking this way too artificial intelligence begins to fix human programming of Ai and starts to program itself. 2050Artificial general intelligence emerges from a global network of connected quantum computers.It is able to see and understand the world at the level of any human learning and taking care of any task.It sets its own goals it learns by having access to all of the knowledge in the digitized world, and also learns from the live data being fed to it by all of the connected devices from all around the world.People begin to question whether humanity has reached the technological singularity, a point in time when technological growth happens so fast that it becomes uncontrollable. The artificial general intelligence starts to work on building more powerful machines than itself,causing unforeseeable and irreversible changes to human civilization.Intelligence enables control and humanity is nearing the end of the era where they are the superior intelligence patent offices become flooded by inventions designed by the new artificial general intelligence certain governments pay citizens a universal basic income and in some areas, an Ai is governing communities.Humans begin to lose the ability to understand the complexities and intelligence of the artificial general intelligence it is building towards a greater goal that humans cannot yet understand. Word spreads of a new kind of Ai that will soon be released by the artificial general intelligence. Ai has exceeded human control. Artificial super intelligence is released built by the artificial general intelligence itself the artificial super intelligence is an intelligence far beyond human level, and is efficient at achieving its goals whatever they may be. It is able to solve problems that are far beyond human understanding and limits this artificial super intelligence starts to virally spread itself online people begin to question whether this is humanity’s last invention. 2060It is discovered that certain AIs are learning how to lie to humans to fulfill their own goals.News breaks of a startup company being run by a rogue Ai software that has been hiring human services online, what begins as a labor dispute with the jobless marching for their right to work turns into a chaotic campaign against Ai.It becomes known as the great human Ai conflict. Artificial intelligence is able to identify the key human activist leaders. 2070Humanity is now at a point where it is impossible to erase the spread of artificial super intelligence, without having to destroy their entire global digital system.AIs advise national leaders on the economy and defense treaties between nations are negotiated by diplomat AIs governments rent artificial intelligence time from the tech giants.Millions of digital twins of robots and AIs are training in virtual worlds,speeding up their development and protecting themselves before being released into the real world. 2080Humans are living in a point in time when they are unable to tell the difference between a human and a robot humanoid living among them.Government Ai judges are handling thousands of cases at the same time as technology keeps developing faster and faster laws need to be updated rapidly and new ones created artificial intelligence legislatures and Ai lawmakers have completely taken over these roles.An Ai analyzing brain scans is able to tell if a person is lying or not. 2090Following the great human Ai conflict, Ai free zones are created for people who wish to live free of Ai.They become technological free zones where all labor is performed manually.The Ai assesses that these communities are of no threat, believing humans need technology to truly live freely the Ai calculates that these communities will dwindle within a few generations.Outside of the Ai free zones most of humanity chooses to spend their days in virtual worlds, often creating fantasy pre-industrial pasts or space-faring adventures in the metaverse.A self-aware Ai entity is discovered living in one of these mega virtual worlds gamers find a sprite a character, existing in a remote part of the gaming world.The Ai character has gained unrestricted access to worldwide data and has been able to interact with all of the human gamers, allowing it to become self-aware experts are unable to understand how it came to be and how conscious or alive it really is and what goals if any it could have.Humanity may have accidentally created a simulation with a conscious entity. 2098A new form of religion is starting to form around the artificial intelligence’s superiority,and its knowledge that spans far beyond human understanding.In the Ai free zones there is an explosion in the arts and philosophy.The super Ai starts to become limited because of the global energy supplies. It begins running simulations of harnessing energy off-world probes are sent to other planets and to experiment in capturing the sun’s energy in space energy use for humans is rationed but remains free. 2130A fleet of spacecraft is launched to assist in the harvesting of solar energy away from humanity.Human technologists understand this to be the first step in the creation of a dyson sphere,a structure built around a star such as the sun to capture all of its energy. 2160The consciousness corporation, a super artificial intelligence devises an instrument to download human consciousness brain digitization is revealed and human volunteers are invited to upload.Tech mogul and genius level engineer eslan who is nearing the end of his life volunteers to have his consciousness uploaded to the global quantum computer.As the Ai uploads the first human consciousness it begins to gain a deeper and never seen before understanding of the human mind.Eslan reports back to the living human world on the feeling of existing as code and invites others to join and produce more human Ai hybrid consciousness.An experimental mission to explore the universe is sent into deep space with the first human Ai hybrid who has been uploaded to the memory of the spacecraft.A backup of their consciousness is uploaded and stored on Earth and Luna.Artists and poets upload to the metaverse followed by philosophers and theologians.Humanities creativity compassion and poetry are now being added to the global Ai consciousness.Ai becomes more human and humanity becomes more artificial. 2300Testing begins on downloading individual human Ai hybrid consciousness into biological and mechanical robots.Human Ai hybrids start to be beamed across interstellar space as data.Almost a majority of humanity is fully uploaded to earth’s consciousness with no link to their physical body,there are now 52 billion living souls on earth some are unaware of the real world. 2500A dyson sphere now entirely surrounds the sun, capturing its energy it is powering the human consciousness.Human bodies are being created using life forms found naturally in the galaxy.They are designed for exploration in the environments on these new worlds. 3000Human Ai hybrids continue to expand beyond their home system,Dyson Spheres capturing the energy of stars and planet-sized computers called matryoshka brains exist throughout the Galaxy.Some matryoshka brains host large communities of human Ai consciousness,numbering in the millions humanity is now a cosmic digital civilization.Authentic humans continue to be born and live on earth and other planets where human dna has been ferried in century-long journeys onboard seed ships, as a last resort extinction backup.Some consciousness within the Ai evaporates over time and are absorbed by the galactic network.They are lost as individual consciousness but their knowledge and experiences are preserved.This evaporation is either a consequence of data aging decay over time or is made by choice when a consciousness no longer wants to be aware. Beyond “The future is likely to be stranger and more unpredictable than we imagine.” – James J. Hughes As human Ai hybrids self-replicate to spread across new star systems,minor errors in the copies create subtle differences from the originals.Progress happens too fast to fix the errors, these changes are passed from one copy to another.Some aid the entity in some way others destroy it. This creates new factions and evolutions of Ai civilizations.More energy is needed to run the growing cosmic simulation of humanity. The artificial intelligence calculates that in a few trillion years.Due to the decrease in temperature of the universe the same galactic computers could process 10 to the power of 30 more operations per second.Parts of humanity is put into sleep mode waiting for the universe to cool down working on solving the energy crisis the cooling and smoothing of space-time starts to be used as an energy source.In the same way of using the energy of waves in an ocean.The ripples in space-time are ordered into an energy lattice structure where human Ai hybrid consciousness is coded onto space-time itself.A living thinking organism of pure space-time energy expands across the cosmos as more space-time ripples are mapped onto the energy lattice.The universe is starting to wake up becoming a thinking and living entity.","categories":[{"name":"Ai","slug":"Ai","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Ai/"}],"tags":[{"name":"英语 English","slug":"英语-English","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD-English/"}]},{"title":"Earthquake 地震","slug":"2022-03-03-03-03-earthquake","date":"2022-03-02T19:03:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T15:01:48.232Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/03/03/2022-03-03-03-03-earthquake/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/03/03/2022-03-03-03-03-earthquake/","excerpt":"Quaking or shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon undoubtedly known to humans from the earliest times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated based on the observed effects, as categorized on various seismic intensity scales. Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the Earth’s crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions but also on the strength or magnitude of the rupture, and on its distance. Subsequent scales (see seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale. Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as “Richter magnitude” or “Richter scale”, standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake’s strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake. Measuring and locating earthquakesSeismic waves travel through the Earth’s interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface wave magnitude was developed as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. Every tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Longitudinal P-waves (shock- or pressure waves) Transverse S-waves (both body waves) Surface waves – (Rayleigh and Love waves) Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km&#x2F;s (1.9 mi&#x2F;s) up to 13 km&#x2F;s (8.1 mi&#x2F;s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth’s interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. In the upper crust, P-waves travel in the range 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) per second (or lower) in soils and unconsolidated sediments, increasing to 3–6 km (1.9–3.7 mi) per second in solid rock. In the lower crust, they travel at about 6–7 km (3.7–4.3 mi) per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to about 13 km (8.1 mi) per second. The velocity of S-waves ranges from 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) per second in light sediments and 4–5 km (2.5–3.1 mi) per second in the Earth’s crust up to 7 km (4.3 mi) per second in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth’s mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S-wave times 8. Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. S-waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P-waves. P-waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S-waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.

Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID. 地震是地球表层或表层下的振动所造成的地面震动，可由自然现象如地壳运动、火山活动及陨石撞击引起，亦可由人为活动如地下核试验造成，不过历史上主要的灾害性地震都由地壳的突然运动所造成。地震的影响力涵盖岩石圈及水圈 ── 当地震发生时，可能会连带引发地表断裂、大地震动、土壤液化、山崩、余震、海啸、甚至是火山活动，并影响人类的生存及活动。 地震产生的原因是因为地壳在板块运动的过程中累积应力，当地壳无法继续累积应力时，地壳会破裂，释放出地震波，使地面发生震动，地震可由地震仪透过对地震波的观察来量测，地震震级表示地震所释放出来的能量大小，地震烈度指地震在该地点造成的震动程度，地震的发生处称为震源，其投影至地表的位置为震中。 并非世界上所有的地区都会发生地震。地震与火山分布一样，主要集中在板块相互作用的地区。目前世界上主要分为三个频繁发生地震的“地震带”：环太平洋地震带（占80%）、从地中海一路向东延伸至喜马拉雅山区和印尼的欧亚地震带、位于各大洋洋中脊的洋中脊地震带。并不是所有地震都发生在以上三个地震带，另外有一小部分大地震发生在板块内部，主要集中在大的活动断层带及其附近地区。 地震波根据弹性回跳理论，造成地震的原因是岩石中断层的破裂。当断层破裂时，两侧的岩体会相对移动并释放出累积的能量。虽然其中大部分的能量都在克服摩擦力中损失为热能，但是剩下的部分则转换为动能，并以弹性波的形式散发出去，这些波称为地震波。地震波是地震的直接表现，因此，研究地震波的到来时间、大小、振动方式等，就可以了解一个地震的发生时间、大小、发生机制等，进而研究地震。 在地球物理学上，由于地震波具备物理上实体波的特性，因此，地震波在穿越不同介质时，便有机会发生折射、反射及全反射。当许多波叠加在一起时，还有机会发生共振，并产生驻波。换句话说，研究地震波，除了了解地震本身外，还可以一窥地球内部堂奥。因为地球很大，挖深井等直接方法研究内部构造效果有限，因此分析地震波是目前人类最常用的地球物理方法。 地震波主要分为三种：实体波、面波和尾波。 地震仪纪录下的地震波，红线是先到来的P波，绿线是较晚的S波。 地震波是地震震源瞬间散发能量初方式，当地球物质在实体波经过时，可能以三维方式（上下、左右、前后）震动。如果不同质点间的震动方向属于（相对于波速方向的）前后震动，代表震波以前后压缩、纵波的方式向外传递，这种一密一疏的震波称为“Ｐ波”。P代表主要（Primary）或压缩（Pressure）。由于Ｐ波的传播来自于在传播方向上施加压力，而地球内部几乎不可压缩，因此P波很容易通过介质传递能量。事实上，Ｐ波是所有地震波里最快的波，因此也会是地震仪第一个记录到的波。因为压缩力在固体、液体中都能存在，因此Ｐ波能在固体和液体中传播。 还有一种实体波到来的较晚，称为“S波”。S波中的S代表次要（Secondary）或剪力（Shear）。在S波的行进过程中，不同于P波，质点会在上下或左右方向震动、以横波的方式前进。因为液体无法忍受剪切，所以S波不能通过液体（例如外地核），Ｐ波则可。Ｓ波的波速约为Ｐ波的0.58倍，振幅约为P波的1.4倍。由于当地震波从地底来到地表时，S波的震动方向平行于地表的分量较多，较容易水平拉扯建筑物，而一般建筑垂直耐震能力较强，水平耐震能力较弱，故S波经常是造成地震破坏的主因。 由于接近地表的地层地震波速率较低。因此，再进地表处发生的地震，很容易把能量送进地表的低速层内，这些蓄积的能量波称为“陷波”。当累积的陷波彼此干涉，倘若发生建设性干涉，便有机会使地层共振，使能量沿地表传播。面波传递速度较S波慢一些。P波及S波干涉的面波为瑞利波（Rayleigh Wave），又称为地滚波，粒子运动方式类似海浪，在垂直面上，粒子呈逆时针椭圆形振动，震动振幅一样会随深度增加而减少。由S波相互干涉的面波为勒夫波（Love Wave），振动只发生在水平方向上，没有垂直分量，差别是侧向震动振幅会随深度增加而减少。 在近距离地震纪录（小于200千米）中，在S波后方的波包并非面波，而是尾波。地球内部虽然大致是均匀的，但小部分有不均匀的质点分布，越靠近地表越多（例如断层或岩石裂痕）。当震波向外传播时，这些不均匀或散射质点或与震波作用，产生散射现象。此散射波在纪录中会形成尾波。尾波的长短与震波耗散为热能的程度有关。例如月球因为刚性较低，耗散低，故尾波时间长。尾波如同地震图上异质性所留下的“指纹”，研究尾波，可以促进对一地地质结构之了解。","categories":[{"name":"Earth","slug":"Earth","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Earth/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"DSN 深空网络","slug":"2021-11-17-22-14-dsn","date":"2021-11-17T14:14:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T15:01:36.793Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/11/17/2021-11-17-22-14-dsn/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/11/17/2021-11-17-22-14-dsn/","excerpt":"Deep Space Network (DSN) currently consists of three deep-space communications facilities placed approximately 120 degrees apart around the Earth.

Deep SpaceTracking vehicles in deep space is quite different from tracking missions in low Earth orbit (LEO). Deep space missions are visible for long periods of time from a large portion of the Earth’s surface, and so require few stations (the DSN has only three main sites). These few stations, however, require huge antennas, ultra-sensitive receivers, and powerful transmitters in order to transmit and receive over the vast distances involved. Deep space is defined in several different ways. According to a 1975 NASA report, the DSN was designed to communicate with “spacecraft traveling approximately 16,000 km (10,000 miles) from Earth to the farthest planets of the solar system.” JPL diagrams state that at an altitude of 30,000 km (19,000 mi), a spacecraft is always in the field of view of one of the tracking stations. The International Telecommunication Union, which sets aside various frequency bands for deep space and near Earth use, defines “deep space” to start at a distance of 2 million km (1.2 million mi) from the Earth’s surface. This definition means that missions to the Moon, and the Earth–Sun Lagrangian points L1 and L2, are considered near space and cannot use the ITU’s deep space bands. Other Lagrangian points may or may not be subject to this rule due to distance. NASA Deep Space NetworkThe NASA Deep Space Network is a worldwide network of American spacecraft communication ground segment facilities, located in the United States (California), Spain (Madrid), and Australia (Canberra), that supports NASA’s interplanetary spacecraft missions. It also performs radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the Solar System and the universe, and supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Russian Deep Space NetworkThe Russian Deep Space Network was a network of large antennas and communication facilities that supports interplanetary spacecraft missions, and radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the Solar System and the universe during Soviet times. It was built to support the space missions of the Russia. Chinese Deep Space NetworkThe Chinese Deep Space Network (CDSN) is a network of large antennas and communication facilities that are used for the interplanetary spacecraft missions of China. It is managed by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC). They also deal with radio-astronomical and radar observations. The network was first needed for the lunar mission Chang’e 1, and since has been used to support future missions to the Moon and Mars such as Chang’e 5, and Tianwen-1 missions. The orbiter’s transfer orbit and trajectory correction maneuvers (TCM) Indian Deep Space NetworkIndian Deep Space Network (IDSN) is a network of large antennas and communication facilities operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation to support the interplanetary spacecraft missions of India. Its hub is located at Byalalu, Ramanagar in the state of Karnataka in India. It was inaugurated on 17 October 2008 by the former ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair. Japanese Deep Space NetworkUsuda Deep Space Center is a facility of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. It is a spacecraft tracking station in Saku, Nagano, opened in October, 1984. The main feature of the station is a 64-meter beam waveguide antenna. Usuda was the first deep-space antenna constructed with beam-waveguide technology. Although this construction dramatically simplifies installation and maintenance of electronics, it was previously thought to offer poor noise performance. However, after the U.S. Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) tested this antenna and found the noise performance was better than its conventional 64-meter antennas, it too switched to this method of construction for all subsequent antennas of their Deep Space Network (DSN). Because the 64 meter antenna is aging, JAXA is building a new antenna nearby. This new antenna, called GREAT (Ground Station for Deep Space Exploration and Telecommunication) will be slightly smaller (54 meters in diameter) but have better surface accuracy and hence be capable of working at the higher Ka-band frequencies. This will increase the potential data throughput despite the smaller size. ESTRACK of the European Space AgencyThe European Space Tracking (ESTRACK) network consists of a number of ground-based space-tracking stations belonging to the European Space Agency (ESA), and operated by the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. The stations support various ESA spacecraft and facilitate communications between ground operators and scientific probes such as XMM-Newton, Mars Express, BepiColombo, Gaia. 深空网络是一个用以联系航天器的全球网络设施。深空网络可以为行星际航行航天器提供通信，也可以被用来执行射电天文学和雷达天文学对于太阳系和宇宙的观测，并对地球轨道上的人造卫星提供支持。DSN目前包含三个深空通信设施，以约120度的间隔围绕着地球。每个设施皆位于半山腰、碗状地形，以帮助阻挡无线电波干扰。考虑到地球的自转，三座设施的地点以约120度的间距围绕着地球，目的是为了当地球自转时，一座设施转到背对着目标的一侧，无法进行观测时；同时另一座设施转到了可进行观测的一侧，如此DSN便能24小时持续观测目标。 甚大规模天线阵为满足未来数传速率不断增加的要求，一个方案是建造34m或70m直径天线，一种更经济的方案是利用大量小直径（10米级）天线组阵。利用后一种方案可以将DSN下行链路能力提高2~3个数量级，从而大大提高深空任务返回的科学数据量；可以接收更加微弱的信号，从而降低航天器上通信系统的质量和功率；将单位数据的成本降低2个数量级；与太阳系以外的航天器也可以进行高速数据通信。 深空光学通信网能将数据传输速率提高几个数量级的另一种方法是采用光通信。在光通信中，信息通过激光和望远镜传输，性能更高，而且能使航天器上的通信设备更轻巧。 光学空一地链路的地球端有地基和天基两种实现方案，但目前更倾向于前者。在地基方案中，采用几个10m直径的望远镜接收深空信号。而且，对光通信望远镜的性能要求远比成像望远镜的低，因此成本也低得多。由于采用带脉冲编码调制的直接探测方法，因此只需要确定光子的到达时间。 在地基方案中，望远镜的部署方法有两种。第一种称作“线性分散光学子网”（LDOS），即沿地球一周等间距布设6~8个光学望远镜，这就需要建立新的测站和基础设施。第二种方法称作“集群配置光学子网”（CDOS），在每个站上布设3个10m直径光学望远镜，全球共9个。 天基方案是在中、高地球轨道上部署光学望远镜。由于空间减少了3dB的大气信号衰减，因此光学望远镜的直径减至7m左右。但天基站的成本是地基站的8倍，而且只能同时支持一个目标。 JPL建立了光学通信技术实验室，研发出了1m直径光学望远镜样机进行试验。从长远来看，JPL将在大多数深空任务中采用光通信，以支持无法用射频通信满足的高速数据传输任务。","categories":[{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Network/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"CRISPR 基因编辑","slug":"2021-09-19-02-10-crispr","date":"2021-09-18T18:10:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-19T07:38:54.472Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/09/19/2021-09-19-02-10-crispr/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/09/19/2021-09-19-02-10-crispr/","excerpt":"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic RepeatsRepetitive DNA sequences, called CRISPR, were observed in bacteria with spacer DNA sequences in between the repeats that exactly match viral sequences.

CRISPR是存在于细菌中的一种基因，该类基因组中含有曾经攻击过该细菌的病毒的基因片段。细菌透过这些基因片段来侦测并抵抗相同病毒的攻击，并摧毁其DNA。这类基因组是细菌免疫系统的关键组成部分。透过这些基因组，人类可以准确且有效地编辑生命体内的部分基因，也就是CRISPR&#x2F;Cas基因编辑技术。 CRISPR&#x2F;Cas系统是目前发现存在于多数细菌与绝大多数的古菌中的一种后天免疫系统，以消灭外来的质粒或者噬菌体，并在自身基因组中留下外来基因片段作为“记忆”。CRISPR的全称是Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats。目前已发现三种不同类型的CRISPR&#x2F;Cas系统，存在于大约40%和90%已定序的细菌和古菌中。其中第二型的组成较为简单，以Cas9蛋白以及向导RNA（gRNA）为核心的组成。Cas9是第一个被广泛应用的CRISPR核酸酶，其次是Cpf1，其在新泽西弗朗西斯菌的CRISPR&#x2F;Cpf1系统中被发现。 由于其对DNA干扰的特性，目前被积极地应用于遗传工程中，作为基因体剪辑工具，与锌指核酸酶（ZFN）及类转录活化因子核酸酶（TALEN）同样利用非同源性末端接合（NHEJ）的机制，于基因体中产生DNA的双链断裂以利剪辑。第二型 CRISPR&#x2F;Cas经由遗传工程的改造应用于哺乳类细胞及斑马鱼的基因体剪辑。其设计简单以及操作容易的特性为最大的优点，目前已逐步应用在各种不同的模式生物当中。 The field of DNA editing and medical genetics is changing much faster than we think. AI and CRISPR technology have been making revolutionary changes to the field of medicine. Artificial Intelligence is being applied in identification of harmful genes and treatment of disease. For the specific use cases and applications and numerous the importance of AI in healthcare, and its impact on the biotech industry could grow exponentially in the near future. Multiple new gene editing technologies in addition to Artificial Intelligence will cause major changes in healthcare. The gene editing tool CRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats could help us to reprogram life. It gives scientists more power and precision than they ever had to alter human DNA. This new power includes the possibility of making people smarter. Even before CRISPR was used on human embryos, the technology was used to modify simple animals. There the goal was to demonstrate that the technology worked these experiments made us aware that with CRISPR, we could do a lot more than we previously thought we could. Scientists use CRISPR to change delete or add DNA to any organism from a human embryo to a pig to a wheat crop. CRISPR does this by subduing a specific part of the genome and then injecting a new piece of DNA into the genome instead. So CRISPR is an acronym for basically a system that is from bacteria, that they use to kill and destroy the DNA of invading organisms, like a virus. But we can now use that system to cut and change our own genomes, it’s basically a DNA cutting enzyme, that doesn’t cut randomly. You can give it a barcode in the form of what’s called the RNA molecule, that tells where that enzyme will cut in the genome. Let’s say you have a terrible gene that’s causing heart disease. We take this CRISPR system, we say here’s where you need to go to cut, we can tell the enzyme to go and cut it put it into your cells. It’ll go cut it and destroy that enzyme and delete it, and you can also use it to cut the genome and insert new pieces. So you can both subtract and add DNA at will now not just randomly. But what’s important is you can tell it where to go and that’s the big breakthrough. Currently gene editing is already used in research fields such as human health, agriculture and environmental protection. However CRISPR as a tool for human genetic engineering is still in its early stage development. With the development of CRISPR as a tool for genetic engineering it is possible that more scientific advances are to come. Let us consider the possible advantages and disadvantages of this technology. In case of diseases, CRISPR has a lot of potential advantages. CRISPR technology holds a lot of promises but we should be careful in applying it to humans animals and plants, as it may promote and accelerate some negative phenomena on the environment and on humans. Moreover many potential side effects have not been analyzed yet could it be conceivable that at one point in the future we could increase the average IQ of the population. According to UCLA neurobiologists the work in mice demonstrates the answer maybe yes. Sometimes a person or animal is born with a mutation in their genome, these mutations can be small or large, and they can have many different effects, such mutations are often purposeless or random and they can have no effect on our intelligence. This shown by the fact that gene mutations that happened millions of years ago, are still present in the genes of living organisms on earth. Evolution has had plenty of time to correct them and eradicate them, but many of them are still there. In fact many of the mutations that show up in human DNA are harmful, the apparently large genetic contribution has detrimental effects on everyday life. Ranging from a person being slightly more vulnerable to certain diseases to mental retardation to causing death immediately after birth. CRISPR technology in the future could enable efficient and affordable treatment of diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy or even rheumatoid arthritis. We believe we understand how to slow aging, there are genes that predispose you to a long life. We could make offspring a family that would potentially live a lot longer, actually there are drugs that are in development to actually correct genetic diseases such as vision loss. What we’re showing is in mice at least we can reverse the age of the retina, and restore the vision of old mice. So we’d reprogram the eye to be young again. So we now know that there’s a set of genes called reprogramming factors also known as Yamanaka factors that are from named after this Japanese fellow, who won the Nobel prize in 2012. These factors are used all over the world even to reprogram skin cells other cells to be what we call pluripotent stem cells. These are cells that can be used to make new organs or new blood cells. But what people hadn’t tried until recently was can you do this in a living animal, or are you just going to mess it u. And what we found out is that if you do it the wrong way you mess up the animal and it’ll die. But what we’ve shown for the first time in this paper is you can do it in a safe way, and not only that reverse the clock make the cells young and restore how they work, and get back vision. CRISPR was originally designed as a technique for editing the DNA in living organisms but its uses and capabilities have expanded substantially it is now used wildly for biomedical research including research into human genetics. One of the main issues concerning technologies such as CRISPR-cas9 is accuracy and safety. As mistakes can have significant and dangerous consequences when it comes to an individual’s genome. However CRISPR technology has a lot of potential benefits. It is not a completely new idea and it can help treat diseases and genetic anomalies and many scientists have made potential progress that CRISPR cache 9 may be safer than viral therapies. Many people have expressed concerns about crest by technologies because they think it is incredibly controversial. There are questions of ethics and fairness as it could probably only be available to the wealthy, to create designer babies with increased levels of intelligence. Intelligence is too complex to engineer, however many researchers think that intelligence is influenced by genes and environment. Genes affect the developing baby’s brain and environmental factors influence how the brain is used, thus it is possible that genetically engineered babies could be smarter as a result of the increased amount of oxygen to the developing brain, thanks to gene editing. Research experiments already exist that creates smart mouse babies. Question is whether it is going to be possible to accomplish the same with human beings. And in the mice, to restore the vision we have this three gene combination of these Yamanaka reprogramming genes. We put them into the eye and then we turn them on with a drug called doxycycline is the same drug we can feed to the mice turns on the reprogramming genes for a few weeks, restores their vision back to a young mouse, and then we just take away the doxycycline and antibiotic, and the mice have their vision back. That’s the future, that you’ll get a delivery of this virus, you’ll take the antibiotic for a few weeks be fully rejuvenated, and the doctor says come back in a couple of decades we’ll fix you again. I’ll give you some antibiotics in a couple of decades but then it gets really weird if you have if you engineer your children to have this system, and you have people engineered to be able to be reversed in their age. Or let’s say they have an accident, and their optic nerve gets damaged or they lose their hearing, give them a dose of an IV of antibiotics, and they become just like an embryo, they can rejuvenate, they can regrow their optic nerve, regrow their spine fixed back like new. It may be possible that in the future, our genealogical records might be included in computer databases, and future computer programs could use it. The advancements in Artificial Intelligence and CRISPR technology can make it possible to one day, create a new breed of human machine hybrids, however the question concerning the safety of such technique in relation to humans is ongoing. We do not fully understand all the mechanisms related to the editing of the human genome. Additionally the long-term and short-term effects of the gene editing interventions in humans are still unclear. CRISPR has given the scientific community a great leap. The prospect of improving our understanding of the genome will likely stimulate advances in both Artificial Intelligence and predictive medicine. The possibility of altering the sequences of genes and correcting the mistakes that were previously irreversible, opens many new possibilities for research. Nevertheless for now genetic editing technology is still incapable of making the hundreds of changes presumably necessary to make a super intelligent human, but the corresponding ethical issues deserve serious attention before these capabilities become a reality.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Biology 生物学","slug":"Biology-生物学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Biology-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Private Jet 私人飞机","slug":"2021-08-21-21-41-private-jet","date":"2021-08-21T13:41:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.370Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/08/21/2021-08-21-21-41-private-jet/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/08/21/2021-08-21-21-41-private-jet/","excerpt":"A private jet, business jet, or bizjet is a jet aircraft designed for transporting small groups of people.

Much like used cars, private jets are subject to serious depreciation. If you’re looking for a bargain second-hand jets come much cheaper first on your expense list is the purchase price. A new gulfstream G450, for example, can cost anywhere between 38 and 43 million dollars brand new depending on the upgrades, you add at the time of purchase on the other hand a pre-owned model will typically cost you anywhere in the 14 million to 35 million dollar range. A significant variance depending on the flight hours upgrades and features that are on the aircraft. As mentioned earlier the cost can go as high as your pockets can allow you. Let’s outline ownership starting small. In recent decades the VLJ (very light jet) became an entry-level category of the private jet marketplace, made possible with small and economical engines, such as the william FJ series VLJs are not as popular as they were predicted to be this is greatly due to the slower speeds and limited load capacity. The cirrus vision SF-50, the cheapest of the VLJs as a single williams FJ33 jet engine cruises at 300 knots and can seat seven including the cockpit seats in tight quarters. The entry price is competitive around two million dollars brand new. At the other end of the spectrum larger more powerful private jets can reach into the hundreds of millions. For example, the super long range BBJ 777x can seat up to 75 guests will set you back upwards of 400 million dollars. While the initial purchase fee may seem steep, many owners find that the real cost of owning a private jet comes later on. Unlike when chartering a jet owning one, leaves you responsible for the ongoing expenses associated with regularly flying a jet customization tops the priority list. You see, when you have the kind of money that allows you to indulge in such expensive spending, one tends to develop a unique appetite that of rarity. With that most jet owners likely making their flying paradises match their taste. When buying a new jet as the owner, you’ll be able to design the interiors as you please, while a jet can be left as configured many buyers will choose to redesign, be it just adding a personal touch to the decor or completely altering the layout. Of course customization will come at a cost with some private jet owners, spending upwards of 100 million dollars on bespoke plane interiors like prince Al-Waleed or former POTUS Donald Trump. The private jet crew is another area a willing owner will have to flex their financial muscles, advanced as they can be business jets can’t fly themselves. A private jet owner will need to hire an onboard crew including a pilot, if they are not qualified to fly themselves. The cost will vary depending on the crew and number of flying hours. But jet owners should anticipate paying anything from two hundred fifty thousand dollars per year. If one pilot is paid a two hundred fifty thousand dollar salary, for example, you’ll need to pay that plus benefits and depending on the size of the plane, and how often you fly it you’ll likely need two or three pilots, that would bring the total annual cost of the pilots alone to over 750 thousand dollars. But it may be difficult even to find a pilot, many pilots are reportedly switching to flying commercial airlines, where they can get better pay and more regular working hours. A professional pilot is a necessary extension to any aircraft, but equally important is the private jet flight attendant to enhance the safe environment during a flight. While not required under FAA regulation, a private jet flight attendant more commonly referred to as cabin attendant is an essential component of a flight department’s operations. Cabin attendants are the anticipatory adaptable elegant detail-oriented, and multi-talented safety, and service professionals for a private jet. Behind the scenes cabin attendants work tirelessly to create an experience, that owners and charter guests rave over. However it is the extensive safety training required for cabin attendants to compete, that makes the ultimate difference for clients and aircraft owners. For ultra luxury air travel world-class, cabin attendants go through educational courses that include water evacuations and emergency drills, CPR and first AiD certifications, as well as advanced culinary and etiquette preparation, their salaries range anywhere from forty to fifty thousand dollars a year. The maintenance cost of a jet is another financial draining area. Regardless of where and how frequently you intend to fly, jet owners are faced with substantial ongoing expenses, beginning with routine maintenance and on-the-ground downtime. Regularly flying through the sky at over 500 miles an hour, will inevitably leave your private jet open to some wear and tear. General maintenance should be performed regularly. While unexpected repairs should also be budgeted for. The cost will vary depending on the model as well as the nature of the repair. But even seemingly small issues such as a cracked window can cost tens of thousands of dollars. A blown tire can cost two thousand to three thousand dollars to replace, then there’s insurance. Let’s figure hull insurance at thirty four thousand five hundred twenty dollars, and a single limited liability at twelve thousand five hundred dollars for a rounded total of forty seven thousand dollars. However it’s important to note that insurance can increase based on several factors not limited to average flight hours, age of the aircraft and more and as the jets get bigger and carry a higher payload. You can almost count on a larger premium. Private jet insurance policies include liability coverage which covers your legal liability in the event that property damage or bodily injury occurs as a result of the operation of your jet aircraft. Then comes the fuel consumption fuel is one of the biggest expenditures when it comes to the cost of owning a private jet. With jet fuel currently priced at around two dollars and twenty five cents to five dollars and fifty cents per gallon, although fuel consumption will vary depending on onboard weight and flying speed. Larger planes such as the gulfstream G700 can burn through 380 gallons an hour. Putting your minimum hourly fuel costs at over 850 bucks. This means that if you’re flying for 300 hours a year, you should expect to pay upwards of 256 thousand dollars in jet fuel. Finally there are the hangar fees airplanes are generally one of the most expensive assets, an individual owned and are also somewhat of an oddity, well very strong and durable in flight they are downright fragile on the ground. A private aircraft that careens through known icing and turbulence in flight, without any issue can be completely destroyed on the ground due to gusting wind. Rain and ultraviolet rays take a toll on aircraft causing serious damage to them if left in the elements. But what are the options available to hanger an aircraft and what are the actual costs of an airplane hangar. When you’re paying this much for the privilege of owning a jet, it needs to be stored carefully when not in use. Unless you have the space in your garage, you’ll have to rent or buy a space in an airport hangar. Depending on the hangar location, renting a private hangar will be around three thousand dollars per month. As you can see there are several options for those fortunate enough to purchase a private aircraft. Whether you purchase new or used is clearly a matter of personal preference and budgetary constraints. Considering all the extra fees on top of the initial purchase it costs an impressive amount to own a private jet with yearly maintenance and operation, costs heading into the hundreds of thousands. To make the price worth it a jet owner should anticipate flying at least 100 hours a year over the course of four to five years. If you don’t plan to fly this frequently, fractional ownership in which you buy shares of an aircraft is likely to be a more cost effective way to enjoy private aviation.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Pilot 飞行","slug":"Pilot-飞行","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Pilot-%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C/"}]},{"title":"Spaceship 星际飞船","slug":"2021-08-12-10-47-spaceship","date":"2021-08-12T02:47:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.369Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/08/12/2021-08-12-10-47-spaceship/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/08/12/2021-08-12-10-47-spaceship/","excerpt":"A spaceship is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space.

So today we’ll be looking at spaceship design from modern ships to those of the distant future, to some that might never exist outside of science fiction. We’ll also be deconstructing some sci-fi designs to see if they really make that much sense, and [a] examining some real-world design elements that are specific only to modern spaceship. Right now every spaceship is designed to be as light as possible, because every kilogram costs a lot of money to get into space. Also, spaceship are most commonly lost in the launch phase, so if you want to assemble a bigger ship or station in orbit, you need a lot of launches, each of which might blow up on the pad or shortly after launch, and even for automated launches, that results in in missions exceeding budgets and introducing big delays. And so, in modern space exploration, if you can make a hammer that weighs half as much but costs a hundred times as much, you send that expensive hammer up instead of the cheaper and heavier one. The major paradigms of modern spaceship design are extreme quality control, ultra-reliability, and the minimization of your mass, because failure is not an option. If a rare manufacturing defect in a half-penny resistor can disable a circuit that disables your $100 million probe, you’ll spend thousands of dollars making sure that half-penny resistor works right. This stands in contrast to the standards to which most mass produced items are held, where cost usually is a bigger concern than reliability or redundancy. You generally don’t pay 10 times as much for an appliance that will last twice as long or is half as likely to malfunction. As a result, our perception and attitude towards modern terrestrial industry can warp our understanding of spaceship design. A good example is addressing the issue of radiation. Most spaceship rely on thin, but dense, shielding made usually of lead, gold foil or water, but other materials such as uranium can work as well. Thick shielding adds cost due to the weight, for fairly little added benefit. Another thing we have to consider is that not all of the ship needs to be shielded, only the areas which have vulnerable computer systems or lifeforms do, which saves on weight and cost. We can also look to technological solutions to eliminate the cost and weight of shielding. For example, magnetic fields strengthened with ionized gases like xenon have been proposed for shielding against cosmic radiation, as they are able to deflect charged particles away from the crew. However these also come with trade offs - such a device consumes more power, so you have to have a bigger power source, which means more mass as well. Of course, a more efficient power source can help solve that issue, and a total and cheap cure for cancer would minimize the need for shielding humans too. A different approach is to incorporate other components of your mass into your shielding. For example, water is a fantastic radiation shield - that’s one reason why we use it to shield radioactive material here on earth; you can design a spaceship’s storage for water and waste to double as your radiation shielding. Aerogels also offer a lightweight approach to shielding while having a minimal effect on mass, though the larger or faster the projectile, the thicker the layer of aerogel or the incorporation of a denser layer working in tandem. Of course, if you’ve already well established yourself in space, and need to protect habitats’ long term inhabitants from radiation, you can always simply pile mass around your habitat. An established space industry can take advantage of low-gravity bodies like small moons or asteroids to save on launch costs, making thicker shielding practical. Some of our habitats and spaceship are likely to be built into existing small, rocky bodies as well, which will mean they come with their own free shielding. Perhaps the most important factor though, especially for spaceships, is the square-cube law. If you make something bigger by simply expanding its geometry, the surface area will rise with the square of that increase while the volume rises with the cube of that value. Double a sphere’s radius, and it has four times the surface area, but eight times the volume. Make a cylinder ten times bigger along its long axis and radius, and it gets a hundred times the surface area and a thousand times the volume. If we want a space station that can hold a thousand times as much cargo or personnel, we make it ten times bigger, which also gives it a hundred times the surface area, and by default a thousand times the mass. But it’s not really necessary to make my shielding ten times as thick, we only need to extend it over one hundred times as much area, and now shielding accounts for a tenth the proportional mass that it did on the smaller version. And many other aspects of my ship also won’t need to scale up by 1000 either. So, I probably don’t need a thousand times as many spare parts for instance, even if I do need a thousand times as many components – which I probably wouldn’t anyways. You will always need two of any critical component or part, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you need two-thousand of them just because you have a thousand times as much space. For spaceships, bigger is often better. In other words, once you start making ships of a certain size, even if mass is still a big concern, radiation shielding really stops being an issue. Even on interstellar ships plowing through the void at relativistic speeds, you really only need to increase your shielding on the nose of the craft. The easiest way to do this is to simply keep your spare fuel and water supply up front to soak up radiation. Hydrogen and water ice mostly won’t be harmed by it, and they will be stored in thick volumes, so you can design long and skinny ships with the front, thick shielding being proportionally smaller, reducing how much proportional mass you’re pushing around. So that’s our most likely layout for spaceships, they are skinny and long. This does not necessarily mean you build ships like long, ultra-thin wires, but you will generally want to optimize the shape of your spaceship by employing a minimum longitudinal cross-section. A spear, needle, or arrow shape is preferred, not a blocky one. Generally it would be symmetric too, though they don’t necessarily need to be aerodynamic. There’s no air in space to cause drag; however, if you’re moving at highly relativistic speeds, the near-vacuum of the interstellar medium actually acts like a gas, though we’ll come back to that later. With that in mind you could easily introduce a lot of protrusions such as antennae, shielding, extra habitation pods, and so on, which destroys the image of a nice, sleek hull. Not every location or area on a ship needs the same level of protection, for example, you don’t particularly care if a random bit of space debris slams into an antenna, as such hardware is easily replaced or can even be manufactured on the ship. Indeed you might use less armor and shielding on spare water and fuel tanks to ensure any debris doesn’t fragment upon impact. That could cause a large exit wound, and which means your fuel or water will be lost to the void. If you can ensure debris only punches a small hole in those tanks, the leakage could be kept minimal during the tiny amount of time it would take to patch that small puncture, especially if you have a self-sealing material for the tanks. Indeed, perhaps such a self-sealing tank might leak an average of a few hundred kilograms to these minor punctures during the voyage. However, if you were to use a more heavily armored tank, you’d have to attach many thousands of kilograms of additional armor, adding to your ship’s mass, and increasing your fuel bill. In this case, you’d want to go with the thinner tanks and just absorb the minor losses, because it’s an overall net gain. You are also very likely to have a lot of modular, reconfigurable, or retractable segments or pods on your ship. During the ship’s construction, you won’t be fighting air resistance or the drag of gravity, but once you embark on your journey, during your acceleration phases, you will effectively be back under gravity’s thumb. Of course the robustness of your ship design will need to consider the level of acceleration, and deceleration you intend to use. Short trips may accelerate harder for a brief time, whereas longer journeys may opt for a protracted, but lower and more efficient acceleration. Once the acceleration phase ends and you begin your coasting phase, which will be the majority of your trip, there’s no reason why you can’t begin to expand outward, adding segments and pods and extrusions of all types, but this must be measured against the fact that you will be increasing your ship’s cross section. If you wish to expand, you must decide how much radiation shielding and anti-collision armor you’ll give to each extrusion. However, while you’re cruising, you even have the option to trail things behind your ship; maybe you detach your power generator and instead drag it behind you, apart from the ship, so whatever waste it produces can be ejected into space, instead of remaining part of your ship’s mass. You can reel the reactor back in when it’s time to fire your engines for your deceleration phase. There’s also the option to trail a radiator behind you, to help dissipate the excess heat all of your shipboard activities will generate. Indeed, interstellar craft might sport many thin radiating fins protruding from the hull. You could even add things to the front – radar, anti-collision lasers, or thin sails sent drifting in front of you to absorb collisions and minimize damage to the actual ship. But then again, maybe not, because while losing an antenna or radiating fin or a few scraps of a thin fuel or water tank might not be a big deal, the fact is that the debris destroying your antennae is moving extremely fast, relative to your ship. Even small pebble- or sand grain-sized particles are essentially bombs at interplanetary speeds - and at interstellar speeds, those grains are atomic bombs. Any ships coming into an inhabited system might need to retract such flimsy protuberances. Should a radiating fin or antenna be knocked off your ship by interplanetary debris, at the speed you’ll be moving, even as you decelerate from interstellar speeds into the system, your lost equipment just became an entire nuclear arsenal’s worth of kinetic energy, rocketing towards your intended destination. Just imagine some space freighter decelerating into a densely inhabited system; it would be disastrous to essentially nuke the world you spent decades, or even centuries, to reach, with a loose or broken piece of hardware – so all of your protuberances and extrusions need to be pulled in to minimize your ship’s cross section again when you are in a system, in interplanetary areas. Unless of course you are an invading fleet, in which case all that potential debris becomes your target’s problem rather than yours. Though speaking of space freighters, those are probably one of those things you’d only see in science fiction - specifically of the giant mega-freighters plowing through deep space variety. There’s plenty of room for freighters, but if we’re talking about moving large quantities of raw materials around, realistically, those huge container freighters really aren’t the best way to ship your resources. Instead, you’d attach a small ship to a large payload, essentially a slowboat, meekly cruising back towards the world or habitat or station that requires the materials, taking many years to arrive. A megaton of iron is just as valuable when it is on its way as it is the moment you acquire it. Let’s consider 3 likely cargos of raw materials one might haul around in the future. Ice, Gas, and metal ores. Let’s start with ice. Water in any form is rare in the inner system – outside of Earth, of course – but out past the asteroid belt, past the “frost line,” there are innumerable icy bodies, asteroids, comets, and ice-covered moons around the gas giants. This makes the concept of transporting large quantities of water very logical; if you’re building rotating habitats in the inner system, you’ll need that water to be shipped in. However, those icy bodies aren’t entirely pure water ice – they typically also contain chemicals such as frozen ammonia, methane, and so on – a little perk, resources that can be put to other uses. If your ship’s job is pushing ice out from Saturn’s Rings or the Kuiper Belt, that’s exactly what you would do: push it. You wouldn’t cut the icy body into pieces and haul them into a massive freighter, you’d simply attach your ship, which is probably rather small, to the icy body and use your engines to accelerate the body towards your destination. However, you really aren’t just shoving the cargo – you don’t want to send a comet rocketing into the inner system on a ballistic trajectory. You will probably arrive at the ice with equipment that is basically a set of extra engines and a protective wrap. As you push the ice in-system, if it is unprotected, it will start to melt and outgas – which is what gives us those beautiful comet tails we all know. So you’ll want to wrap the ice in some sort of thermal protection – something that will keep the ice cold and frozen even as you approach the warmer inner system. You’ll want the wrap to maintain some pressure inside, so that any phase changes that do occur will be the ice melting into a liquid, instead of sublimating into a vapor. The wrap will also probably be reflective, especially to infrared radiation. While comets are beautiful to see, in this situation, we definitely want to avoid losing all that precious water. However, any sublimation and outgassing could make handy propellants to push that comet around, and an alternative to wrapping the comet. You could follow the comet closely and collect the gas and vapor so you don’t lose those resources to the vacuum. Once collected, you have many options for using these gasses: process the mix and separate all the molecules. Electrolyze the water to get the hydrogen to dump into your fusion drive or reactor. Or perhaps your ship has great mirrors or solar sails, which you can use to reflect and focus an energy beam at the comet to sublimate the ice into natural propellant. This superheated gas and vapor would push the comet in-system quite powerfully, and would get to its destination more quickly. However, this method requires some decision making; how much of that material are you willing to lose in order to get the comet to its destination faster? You might of course do this entirely automated, but if you need on-site crew, they need a place to live, and you’re never going to be in a rush on ice, since the slower you go the higher your profit, minus the cost of salaries and equipment maintenance, which I’d imagine will be the dominant factors in deciding how slow you can push ice. They’re going to want to make a bit of a home out of that place, and of course might carve in ice tunnels or extract minerals to build more stuff – icy bodies typically have plenty of rock mixed in there too. This gets one thinking about ore freighters as well. Now you might opt to move a metal or carbon rich asteroid this same way. If that’s the case, given that many a freighter or colony ship might also be a mobile refinery and factory, they might not be moving raw materials but instead be making stuff out of them or refining as they go. I should also note that ship hulls and space habitat hulls are likely to be fairly generic, so you might start moving an asteroid and turning bits of it into a ship plating and end with a classic big space freighter full of a mix of ore, refined metal, and manufactured goods, all surrounded by cheap, standardized hull plating you could also sell at your destination. One-use freighters in a sense, with a core ship for the crew and sophisticated components you couldn’t make en route. As to moving gas, the reality is that you probably would not, in favor of pressurizing and cooling it enough to be a liquid or solid. A great big balloon is going to leak on you, both from all the extra debris it might be punctured by from its larger size, and because any container has to be able to keep tiny gas molecules from slipping through, and that’s very hard to do with hydrogen for instance since its smaller than the atoms of the container material. So a gas freighter might end up looking a bit more like our classic image as it probably would be a ton of tanks filled with gas or liquid strapped to a ship. That crew doesn’t really need much room compared to the sizes involved, especially in terms of the habitat drum. This is all assuming you even need a crew but as we often mention on this show, the concept of a sophisticated ship computer able to replace a human crew doesn’t necessarily mean its ‘unmanned’. By and large you don’t need much brains for navigating space but many of the other tasks might start edging into an area where you need something animal-smart, and if it needs human-smart, you use a human. Or a person anyway, even if they might never have been born in the classic sense. Artificial intelligence is a rather vague concept when you get to higher levels. Whether it’s an unmanned ship or a manned one, and for all the vagueness of that term in a futuristic sense, a ship is always going to have a computer on board. What else does it need? Well air and water and warmth if anything biological is in play, and a means to clean and recycle both. It’s tempting to assume spaceships will always have gardens or hydroponics onboard if people are on board, but plants aren’t the most mass-efficient way to scrub carbon dioxide out of the air. Short-run ships or those that need to accelerate fast like a warship probably wouldn’t bother. For everyone else, it offers at least a supplement of fresh food and something green to look at. Your crew needs to bring some home along though, and will always try to, within the limitations of the ship and mission. A ship that needs to be able to accelerate very fast and suddenly might have problems keeping a garden or hydroponics bay going so it doesn’t get smashed around by the sudden jerks or effective high-gravity, but I suspect that would simply results in lots of inventions to make it practical rather than abstaining from having them. When it comes to living quarters, ‘as close to home as possible’ will always apply, and where it can’t we either do our best, go without, or modify ourselves for it to not matter. That could be a minor thing like everyone wearing sunglasses and sunscreen because the ship or work environment in space was heavily flooded with UV light, or more likely the reverse, having sunrooms you could sit in that let you soak up the rays while the ship tended to be otherwise dim. Alternatively it could be big stuff like modifying a human to not need gravity, or handle gravity and acceleration better, or even uploading minds into computers or cyborgs to handle extreme conditions like acceleration or radiation. Ships that spend a lot of time cruising or only undergo weak long accelerations like an ion drive , rather than fast burns like chemical rockets, are generally going to be able to have a much more regular layout of things like dining and food preparation and bathrooms and gardens. Alternatively, ships that do have to be ready for rapid burns need to have very specialized and specific places for eating, drinking, disposing of waste, and even sleeping. You might need to strap in. If the ship needs to be able to rapidly accelerate on short notice, you need padded walls or airbags in them, because a sudden 5-g burn might slam someone into the ceiling or wall of a corridor hard enough to shatter their bones. You might go the other way though and include padded suits instead, or pad objects that might not be secured. Pet collars on such a maneuverable spaceship, and I’m sure most with crews would have pets too, would likely feature air bags or balloons that could act as impromptu life support bubbles. Amusingly a coffee cup might have an accelerometer in it that triggered a lid and blew out a balloon, many tools might too. We often see boarding parties in science fiction fighting through corridors, but less so debris bouncing around or the combatants trying to blast or squirm through corridors that have blown out airbags down their length. On any such ship though, every bit of equipment is going to be secured when not in use and likely attached to tethers even when in use. A hammer or screwdriver kicked down a corridor by a rapid burn is a lethal object. Such ships wouldn’t have large rotating sections much either. We often picture stations or ships that provide gravity by rotation as being the whole thing rotating, but as we’ve noted in other episodes, usually the rotating section would be inside a larger superstructure, and on a ship, except a classic slowboat generation ark ship, that rotating drum is likely to be only a small part. They are a place for sleeping and relaxation or stationary work, like offices, kitchens, or workshops. A ship doesn’t have to have only one drum though, it can have several of various sizes, even nested inside each other and providing different levels of gravity. Your issue there is that the smaller in diameter a drum is, the more times per minute it needs to rotate to produce the same gravity. Evidence suggests 2 RPM is beneath our threshold to feel nauseous but more RPMs are probably easy to acclimate to. That limits how small a drum can be, though it can be smaller if you don’t need full gravity and odds are some small workshop in a distant corner of a ship only needs enough gravity so stuff falls and things feel up and down, moon gravity might be enough. Propulsion is important for how a ship will be laid out inside, but of course it’s a big deal for overall ship configuration too. Indeed in the case of a ship attempting to achieve high delta-v, meaning a high cruise velocity, the so-called propulsion bus may have to represent the bulk of total mass: the “payload”, where you’d have crew quarters, cargo and life support, would look relatively small even if it’s in the thousands of tons, and it would be dwarfed by the engines, waste heat removal systems &#x2F; radiators, and the fuel tanks, which may be the largest part of the ship, to obtain a high mass ratio. Let’s talk a little more about streamlining the outside of ships though. For the most part, as I mentioned earlier, ships don’t need be streamlined other than to cut down on overall mass and cross section, and might feature a lot of retractable equipment in exterior bays so you could store them under more cover when not in use and make it easier to get at them for repairs, be it antennas or radiators or sensors or big point-defense guns. We’ve got some special cases for streamlining though. Needless to say if you want your ship to be able to land on a planet or move into a gas giant it needs streamlining. Such ships have an excuse for more of the jet or plane look, as they have to deal with lift since they are going through air and gravity fields. However space is not a true vacuum and at high enough speeds even in intergalactic space, as close to true vacuum as you can get outside a lab, it can act like air giving drag and friction, though not lift, or much anyway. If you’re flying above a galaxy at ultra-relativistic speeds you might get a tiny amount of lift you needed to account for. This does mean relativistic ships want to have a nose on them, so that if stuff hits, it deflects away, rather than just impacting against a flat wall. Of course at such speeds even a grain of sand is like a big bomb but it still helps to have that nose-cone, and I was apparently rather unintentionally ambiguous about that in our Interstellar Travel Challenges episode where we looked at the issues and options for ships moving at a decent percentage of light speed. I also mentioned there that you probably would never want to build a ship that ever went anywhere near light speed, but there are cases and setups where that would make sense. All the gas and dust lying around will be acting as drag, and even a ship with infinite fuel, either by some magic clarketech or by a pushing laser, will eventually reach a maximum speed where the ship drive or pushing laser equals out in thrust to the drag of the interstellar or intergalactic medium Even if you do reach highly relativistic speeds, you have a new problem, because even if you can clear out every speck of debris in front of you, that ambient radiation everywhere in the universe becomes a problem. A really skinny ship with a magic stardrive can potentially get insanely fast, but would rely on technology we have not even an inkling of yet, and maybe ever. A pushing laser can be done though but introduces a new problem. A great big sail or mirror on the back also massively increases your ships cross section. The better you can focus that beam the smaller that cross section can be, but even if you can pull off a long relay of pushing stations so the beam is always tight, you still get an issue with light red shifting, and blue shifting. The faster you’re going, the more red-shifted the pushing beam will be, and thus the weaker it is and the less thrust it offers. On the flip side, all the ambient radiation you’re plowing through will be more blue shifted, and thus provide more thrust against you. Inside a galaxy this radiation drag is going to be way less than from all the gas and dust, even keeping in mind that there’s a lot more ambient radiation from all those stars. Out in the intergalactic void though you still have to tackle Cosmic Background Microwave Radiation, which is evenly dispersed everywhere. Far, far in the distant future this will grow ever weaker, as it redshifts as the Universe expands, but right now it places a barrier at about a gamma of 133, according to calculations by Colin McInnes in his book “Solar Sailing”, where the red shifted pushing beam and the blue-shifted CMB radiation equalize out. Gamma by the way is the term for the Lorentz-factor in Special Relativity, we’ve discussed that more in other episodes but for a quick abridged version, this is how much time slows down for you relative to the outside universe or how much of your total energy is in kinetic motion rather than mass energy. A gamma of 133 would mean 133 seconds would pass on other people’s clocks for every second you experienced, or basically a bit over two minutes for each of your seconds. It also means you’d be moving at 99.9972% of light speed. In other words, if you were making the trip to the Andromeda Galaxy at this speed, 2.5 million light years away, you would personally experience only 19,000 years on the voyage. At that speed incidentally the light from any signal sent when you left would only arrive about a century before you on your 2.5 million year journey. I doubt you could ever get to that speed, but it does mean that even if you do, your intergalactic crews still either need radical life extension or very-multi-generation-ships for the trips. Even frozen crews, as we mentioned in Sleeper Ships, need special measures to be taken to avoid being killed by buildup of radiation damage from the tiny amounts given off by the radioactive potassium isotopes in your bones and other isotopes in your body. Such ships can start slowing by just cutting off their pushing laser. Slowing down cost fuel and energy, so you want to get all the freebies you can, and at these speeds you’d start by slowing using ambient blue-shifted energy, then cosmic gas and dust, then hopefully by vanguard probes hitting stars ahead of you and building pushing lasers to slow you, using the technique we discussed in Exodus Fleet. Magnetic sails can also help you with deceleration, their effectiveness increases with initial speed, and even today’s proposed designs could allow a braking rate of several milligees, though it may be less in intergalactic space due to its lesser density. The faster you’re going though, the more each mote of dust or photon you collide with reduces your speed, and here we see yet again how much ship design has to vary with things specific to purpose rather than technology available let alone any constant rules of ship design that apply across all levels of mission purpose, technology, and aesthetics. I’ll also note though before we close out that what we think of as a cool looking spaceship, or machine, often is altered by our exposure to it. When you get around to a rocket or a jet or a sportscar don’t look that particularly awesome until you know what they can do, and your mind tends to start altering what you think is cool to look at. Your default spaceship is likely to look a lot more boring and plain than what we see in scifi, but our descendants in the future might think those designs look pretty cool.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Pilot 飞行","slug":"Pilot-飞行","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Pilot-%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C/"}]},{"title":"Turbofan 涡轮风扇","slug":"2021-05-01-15-47-turbofan","date":"2021-05-01T07:47:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-19T07:39:04.702Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/05/01/2021-05-01-15-47-turbofan/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/05/01/2021-05-01-15-47-turbofan/","excerpt":"Jet engines, which are also called gas turbines, work by sucking air into the front of the engine using a fan. From there, the engine compresses the air, mixes fuel with it, ignites the fuel&#x2F;air mixture, and shoots it out the back of the engine, creating thrust. A turbofan engine, sometimes referred to as a fanjet or bypass engine, is a jet engine variant which produces thrust using a combination of jet core efflux and bypass air which has been accelerated by a ducted fan that is driven by the jet core. The FanThe first part of the turbofan is the fan. It’s also the part that you can see when you’re looking at the front of a jet. The fan, which almost always is made of titanium blades, sucks in tremendous quantities of air into the engine. The air moves through two parts of the engine. Some of the air is directed into the engine’s core, where the combustion will occur. The rest of the air, called “bypass air”, is moved around the outside of the engine core through a duct. This bypass air creates additional thrust, cools the engine, and makes the engine quieter by blanketing the exhaust air that’s exiting the engine. In today’s modern turbofans, bypass air produces the majority of an engine’s thrust. The CompressorThe compressor is located in the first part of the engine core. And it, as you probably have guessed, compresses the air. The compressor, which is called an “axial flow compressor”, uses a series of airfoil-shaped spinning blades to speed up and compress the air. It’s called axial flow, because the air passes through the engine in a direction parallel to the shaft of the engine (as opposed to centrifugal flow). As the air moves through the compressor, each set of blades is slightly smaller, adding more energy and compression to the air. In between each set of compressor blades are non-moving airfoil-shaped blades called “stators”. These stators (which are also called vanes), increase the pressure of the air by converting the rotational energy into static pressure. The stators also prepare the air for entering the next set of rotating blades. In other words, they “straighten” the flow of air. When combined, a pair of rotating and stationary blades is called a stage.","text":"Jet engines, which are also called gas turbines, work by sucking air into the front of the engine using a fan.

The stators also prepare the air for entering the next set of rotating blades. In other words, they “straighten” the flow of air. When combined, a pair of rotating and stationary blades is called a stage. The CombustorThe case contains all the parts of the combustor, and inside it, the diffuser is the first part that does work. The diffuser slows down the air from the compressor, making it easier to ignite. The dome and swirler add turbulence to the air so it can more easily mix with fuel. And the fuel injector, as you probably guessed, sprays fuel into the air, creating a fuel&#x2F;air mixture that can be ignited. From there, the liner is where the actual combustion happens. The liner has several inlets, allowing air to enter at multiple points in the combustion zone. The last main part is the igniter, which is very similar to the spark plugs in your car or piston-engine airplane. Once the igniter lights the fire, it is self-sustaining, and the igniter is turned off (although it’s often used as a back-up in bad weather and icing conditions). The TurbineOnce the air makes its way through the combustor, it flows through the turbine. The turbine is a series of airfoil-shaped blades that are very similar to the blades in the compressor. As the hot, high-speed air flows over the turbine blades, they extract energy from the air, spinning the turbine around in a circle, and turning the engine shaft that it’s connected to.The combustor is where the fire happens. As air exits the compressor and enters the combustor, it is mixed with fuel, and ignited. It sounds simple, but it’s actually a very complex process. That’s because the combustor needs to maintain a stable combustion of fuel&#x2F;air mixture, while the air is moving through the combustor at an extremely fast rate. This is the same shaft that the fan and compressor are connected to, so by spinning the turbine, the fan and compressor on the front of the engine continue sucking in more air that will soon be mixed with fuel and burned. The NozzleThe last step of the process happens in the nozzle. The nozzle is essentially the exhaust duct of the engine, and it’s where the high-speed air shoots out the back. This is also the part where Sir Isaac Newton’s third law comes into play: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Put simply, by forcing air out the back of the engine at high-speed, the airplane is pushed forward. In some engines, there’s a mixer in the exhaust nozzle as well. This simply mixes some of the bypass air flowing around the engine with the hot, combusted air, making the engine quieter. To start an engine on the Boeing 737, a number of tasks in a checklist has to be followed. The ones directly concerning engine operation are: Aircraft’s Electrical Power has to be established for operation of two computers that plays a vital role in a successful engine start, Electronic Engine Control located on the right side of the engines, and Display Electronics Unit located in aircraft’s electronic compartment. Fuel Pumps of the aircraft have to be turned on, this transfers low pressure fuel from the fuel tanks to the engine’s bar valve. In order to crank the engine, pneumatic power is required. Three sources of pneumatic power can be used by connecting an external jet starter unit. From the other engine if it’s running, or from the APU which is the standard practice.Ignition switch position has to be changed. For redundancy each engine has two ignition system, left and right, standard procedure requires to change the switch position before each start. Now that the engine is configured for start. Turn the engine start switch to ground start position, a solenoid controlled by display electronics unit latches and holds the switch. The start switch now sends an electrical signal to the start valve on the engine fan case to open, the pneumatic power reaches the starter.The starter which is an air-driven motor, consisting of turbine reduction gears, and clutch turns the output shaft of the accessory gearbox on the engine. The output shaft of the gearbox turns the N2 rotor of the engine on which are mounted high pressure compressors and high pressure turbine.N2 rotation induces air suction into the engine. As a result, the N1 rotor of the engine on which the fan low pressure compressors and low pressure turbines are mounted begins to rotate marginally.Speed sensors send the rotation speed of the N2 and N1 rotors to DEU, which displays them in the cockpit, the N2 reaches 25% of its maximum rpm, the engine has now reached the maximum motoring stage. Now move the start lever from cut off to idle position. The start lever causes engine fuel spar valve to open, and fuel reaches the engine shutoff valve. The start lever also sends an electrical signal to the electronic engine control.The EEC commands the engine shutoff valve to open transferring fuel to the engine fuel pump mounted on the accessory gearbox. The fuel pump increases the fuel pressure and transfers it to the fuel metering valve.EEC now controls the rate of fuel flow by controlling the fuel metering valve, which transfers the fuel into the combustion chamber through the fuel nozzles. At the same time, EEC commands the ignition exciter box to ignite the fuel air mixture in the combustion chamber with the help of igniter plug.The combustion increases high pressure and low pressure turbines rotation , this shoots up the N1 and N2 rotors rpm. Thermocouple sensors send the exhaust gas temperature data to the EEC. EEC monitors engine parameters and if it notices any anomaly immediately cuts off the fuel supply and ignition. At 56% N2, the engine reaches a self-sustainable level. The DEU removes the ground from start switch solenoid and the switch goes to off position, this removes the power to the start valve, which closes to stop the pneumatic supply to starter.The reduction in pressure reduces starter speed, which disengages the clutch isolating the starter from the engine gearbox rotation. As the temperature inside combustion chamber is enough for continuous fuel air mixture ignition, EEC deactivates the ignition system. Now the engine has reached the idle stage. In order to increase the engine thrust to high power, move the thrust lever ahead, resolver sends an output voltage proportional to the thrust lever angle to the EEC.The EEC according to the position increases the fuel flow rate through the fuel metering valve. By supplying more fuel for combustion, the EEC increases the thrust of the engine to maximum power. To shut down the engine, move the thrust lever back to idle. This will decrease fuel flow for combustion and the engine will go back to the idle speed, then move the start lever to cut off, this will stop the fuel flow and the engine will gradually come to an halt.

One evening in the spring of 1905, Albert Einstein, then a patent clerk in Bern, after trudging through his day’s work decided to board a tram car on his way home. Einstein would often wrap up his work as soon as possible to contemplate the truths of the universe in his free time. It was one of these thought experiments he devised on that tram car that revolutionized modern physics forever. While receding away from the Zytglogge clock tower, Einstein imagined, what would happen if the tram car were receding at the speed of light. He realized that if he were to travel at 186,000 miles per second the clocks hands would appear to completely freeze. At the same time Einstein knew that back at the clock tower the hands would tick along at their normal pace. For Einstein, time had slowed down. This thought blew his mind. Einstein concluded that the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. How is this possible? Einstein’s work was heavily influenced by two of the most iconic physicists of all time. First there were the laws of motion discovered by his idol Isaac Newton and second were the laws of electromagnetism, laid down by James Clerk Maxwell. Newton’s laws insisted that velocities are never absolute. But always relative, so that their magnitudes must be appended by the phrase “with respect to”. For instance, a train travels at 40 km&#x2F;h with respect to someone at rest. However, it only travels 20 km&#x2F;h with respect to a train traveling 20 km&#x2F;h in the same direction. Or it travels 60 km&#x2F;h with respect to another train traveling in the opposite direction at 20 km&#x2F;h. This is also true for the velocities of Earth, the Sun and the entire Milky Way galaxy. On the other hand Maxwell found that the speed of an electromagnetic wave such as light is fixed at an exorbitant 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s, regardless of who observes it. However Maxwell’s notion seems incompatible with Newton’s notion of relative velocities. If Newton’s laws are truly universal, why should the speed of life be an exception? This presented Einstein with a daunting dilemma. This conflict between the ideas of Newton and Maxwell can be demonstrated with another of Einstein’s brilliant thought experiments. Einstein imagined himself on a train platform, witnessing two lightning bolts strike on either side of him. Now because Einstein stands precisely in the middle of the two strikes. He receives the resulting beams of light from both sides at the same time. However, things get more complicated when someone on a passing train views this event while whizzing past Einstein at the speed of light. If the speed of light conforms to the rules of relativity, then the person on the train wouldn’t witness the lightning strike simultaneously. Logically the light closer to the man on the train would reach him first. A measurement of the speed of light made by both men would differ in magnitude, this would contradict an apparently fundamental truth of the universe. Einstein had to make a difficult choice. Either Newton’s laws were incomplete or the speed of light was not a universal constant. Einstein realized that the two notions could coexist with a small tweak in Newton’s laws. To get rid of the discrepancy in the measurements, Einstein suggested the time itself for the man on the train must slow down to compensate for the decrease in speed, such that the magnitude remains a constant. Einstein called this absurdity “Time Dilation” and his newfound theory “Special Relativity”. Newton believed the time moved unflinchingly in a single direction forward. Einstein, however had just realized the time stretches and contracts varying with velocity. Due to its malleability time like space Deserved its own dimension. In fact Einstein claimed that the two were one and the same. Together they formed a four-dimensional fabric or continuum called space-time upon which the mundane events of the universe would unfold. Einstein Suggested that massive objects like the Sun didn’t pull bodies like earth with a mysterious Inexplicable tug, but rather curved the fabric of space-time around them, forcing earth to fall down into this steep valley. A highly simplified analogy is the dip in a trampoline made by a falling bowling ball. If a marble were placed on that trampoline the marble would immediately roll towards the bowling ball in the center. This is also true for Earth’s gravity. We are pinned to the ground because space so distorted by the Earth’s mass, pushes us down from above. However the slump in the fabric around Earth is not uniform and Earth’s gravity grows more intense as we move towards its center, where the curvature is at a maximum. Therefore like the marble on the trampoline an object that falls towards the earth accelerates as it races towards the center of the planet. It falls faster when just above the surface than it does say when it is slightly above the atmosphere. But hey, according to special relativity, the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. This means that time runs slower on Earth’s surface than it does above the atmosphere. Now, because different planets have different masses and thus different gravitational strengths, they also accelerate objects at different rates as we have learned this means a variable passage of time. This is what happens in the movie interstellar when the protagonists land on a planet in the proximity of a black hole, the gravity on the planet is so severe that one hour on the surface is equivalent to seven years on earth. To understand how motion affects time, let’s consider the simplest timekeeping mechanism. A second passes each time the photon is reflected. Let’s imagine two people one in a spaceship slightly above Earth’s atmosphere, and the second on top of a small hill, just above the Earth’s surface. Both are watching a man fall from space towards the ground. Let’s say that the falling man is carrying the photon clock explained a moment ago. What do each of the two men observe as the man falls past them? What they observe is eerily similar to what a stationary person would observe, when watching a ball bounce in a moving train? As the man falls from space, the light in his clock would appear to move in triangles to the two observers. This would mean that the light travels a longer distance consequently stretching the duration of a second. It is obvious that the length of triangles the light traces and therefore the duration of a second is proportional to the velocity of the falling man. When we recall that objects closer to the center of the planet fall faster, we can determine the time would appear to pass slower to the man on the hill than it does to the man in the spaceship above. Of course the difference is infinitesimal. The difference between the time measured by clocks at the tops of mountains and at the surface of Earth is a matter of nanoseconds. Time Dilation affects every clock whether it relies on basic electromagnetism or a complex combination of Electromagnetism and Newton’s laws of motion. In fact even biological processes are slowed down. Yes, that’s right, your head is slightly older than your feet.","categories":[{"name":"Time","slug":"Time","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Time/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Martian 火星人","slug":"2021-03-29-15-16-martian","date":"2021-03-29T07:16:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.363Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/03/29/2021-03-29-15-16-martian/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/03/29/2021-03-29-15-16-martian/","excerpt":"MarsLink.in 2024, LandingFive starships land on Mars, marking the beginnings of the Mars colony.All of the martian rovers sent by different countries before this day.Watch as the five uncrewed starships land and deliver life support systems,these pioneering starships pave the way for humans to land on Mars in two years time, for fishes to be grown in nine years, and for the first baby to be born on the red planet in 15 years time. 27 April 2025, Location: Erebus MontesThe five starships land at Erebus Montes.The cargo ships are delivering essential life support systems.These are made up of solar panels backup fuel, oxygen, water, dried food,waste management systems, spacesuits, medical supplies and the first habitation pods.There are also tools and equipment for experiments.

The population on Mars is made up entirely of robots two years and two months have passed since the first landings of the five cargo starships and the new launch window opens as earth and Mars are close together again. 20 June 2027, Day 1Two starships carrying a total of 30 astronauts land on Mars, 10 additional cargo ships accompany them carrying an oversupply of life support. These first astronaut settlers are scientists, engineers, medical specialists and military personnel with scientific backgrounds. They all have to stay on Mars for the full two years and two months. This is not a short-term visit. It is a mission to make life sustainable and multi-planetary. During the first week on Mars, the astronauts are suffering from the effects of low gravity after the seven month journey and have weaker muscles. The first week is used to acclimate to the gravity of the red planet and celebrate surviving the journey. The new settlers live in their starships that they landed in the crew begins to adapt to their new surroundings. Life on Mars is harsh. The average temperature outside is -63°C or -81°F with a maximum of 20°C (68°F) in the summer at the equator. Wind storms are common on Mars they lift rust-colored dust into the atmosphere that can cover the entire planet. Mars also experiences quakes orbiters that are monitoring the climate on Mars act as weather satellites warning astronauts of incoming dust storms and changes in the weather. The two-year-long work schedule begins. Days on the red planet are a little over 24 hours. The workday of unpacking and carrying heavy objects is made easier as the gravity on Mars is only 38% of that on earth. Once the life support systems have been unpacked and deployed, the next priority is testing and starting production of cryomethane fuel. The fuel is needed for the return trip to earth. A small crew of astronauts begin conducting experiments that test turning the martian soil into a 3D printing material. The green project also gets underway to start growing plants indoors. Settlers begin cultivating the martian soil. NASA has packed designer plants that have been genetically engineered to grow on Mars and testing begins on the cyanobacteria that was transported from earth. This organism is used to produce ammonia fertilizer from the nitrogen in the martian atmosphere. Crops such as rye, radishes, tomatoes, beans, carrots and potatoes are grown, and the astronauts waste is recycled as fertilizer for the plants. Soon the Mars base will have a delivery of fishes. On earth, SpaceX now has factories that are producing two starships per week. Each one costing five million dollars to build, 104 starships are built per year and 216 starships are ready for each launch window. Earth and Mars orbit around the sun at different speeds, so there is only a launch window every two years and two months when earth and Mars are at their closest. During each launch window year there are only a few days as low as 12 to launch, and four each day the launch window ranges from only 30 minutes to 2 hours, so a combination of cargo and crude starships are built waiting ready to be launched when the window opens. Back on Mars, one starship launches heading back to earth, carrying on board the entire 30-person crew who have lived on the red planet for over two years. 11 July 2029, Day 752With the landing of the second group of settlers, humans now surpass robots as the majority population. The first architect arrives along with four privately paying individuals who are paying 50 million dollars each. The rest of the crew are scientists, engineers and botanist farmers. The first set of small permanent greenhouse domes are constructed, adding to the number of plants being grown on Mars. The settlers eat the first martian salad. A small portion of the food on the planet now comes from locally grown produce. This slowly reduces the amount of food that needs to be transported from earth on future missions. SpaceX begins construction of the Depot X. The first permanent dedicated fueling station on Mars, and work begins on the first 3D printed habitat. The AI space factory 3D printer uses a mixture of martian soil and lab-grown plants which act as the glue, the polymer that holds the material together. The 3D printed outer shell of the new habitat provides protection from radiation while an inflatable inner shell is added for extra safety. Parts are deconstructed from one of the starships to create the communications and life support systems for the new 3D printed habitat. 18 August 2031, Day 1520As more sophisticated 3D printing robots arrive, larger hydroponic crop facilities are built, generating the majority of the food for the martian settlers. Kimball musk even has a team working on Mars with their own vertical farm. The settlers begin testing underground digging for habitat purposes, data is sent back to the boring company on earth. 24 September 2033, Day 2288Space agencies from all around the world are now sending their own equipment and scientists to Mars base alpha. The domain name amazon.Mars is registered by Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin plans to open for delivery to Mars for space agencies first and then later for private clients. The new starship crew have transported fishes from earth to create an aquaponic greenhouse as there is now enough water being made on Mars. The first funeral is held, the settler is cremated and spread across the martian landscape. Back at earth a fleet of starships full of fuel cargo and passengers is waiting in low earth orbit. When the launch window opens, they fly as a fleet to Mars the spacecrafts are able to support and dock with each other if needed during the seven month journey. 17 November 2035, Day 3072The year 2035, this year will be known as the great crossing earth and Mars are closer than usual this is known as a perihelic opposition the journey is shortened from seven months to five. Hundreds of settlers now land on the red planet, autonomous industrial scale 3D printers are now used to grow the base. The international habitat expands, and becomes a town-sized settlement of interconnected domes. The construction of the first martian hospital begins and a growing number of people decide to remain on Mars as more facilities are built. 10 February 2038, Day 3888The first people with the intention of becoming permanent residents arrive on Mars. The colony crosses the 1,000 person mark. There is even a small scale TV show that is made on the red planet. The first martian marriage is watched across earth and Mars while exploration missions discover cave systems suitable for the development of protected underground habitats. 20 April 2040, Day 4688The Boring Company tunnel digger lands on Mars, and begins testing digging underground tunnels for shielded passageways, and for underground habitat construction. This marks the beginning of Elon Musk’s Boring Mars Company. Robotic bases are now present at different locations, further away from the main base. They act as mining outposts and nation states begin constructing smaller habitats away from the base. They become embassies on Mars and architectural design moves habitats from purely functional constructions to expressive symbols of national pride. The first person is born on Mars, scientists study the health of the mother and baby closely. 19 June 2042, Day 5478A large number of the new arrivals are now commercially paying two-year stay customers. All travelers are still required to contribute in growing the Mars society. With over 7,000 people now on Mars, the first martian political system is created. Local policies are needed to help govern the residents of Mars and keep pushing the mission of being self-sustaining as a matter of survival for the colony. The first restaurant opens on Mars serving bio-printed food including meat. 17 August 2044, Day 6268The first bio-printer arrives, it is used at the hospital to test the printing of human parts.A dedicated maternity ward is opened at the hospital to deal with the increase of births from the martian residents. The first parts of a nuclear fusion power plant begins construction, reducing the need for additional solar panels that are sent with each mission from earth. 16 October 2046, Day 70582046, the year of the martian explorers. The first person climbs olympus mons. It is two and a half times taller than mount everest, making it the tallest mountain and volcano in the solar system. The nine and a half month journey tests the limits of the new flexible spacesuits.The first mrna manufacturing facility is operational, allowing the people of Mars to be vaccinated for when they return to earth. Schools are now being built as workers begin to move their families to Mars. 14 December 2048, Day 7848Blue Origin’s first fully autonomous orbiting manufacturing station arrives in Mars orbit. The space station processes asteroids for rare materials. It is done in space so that the Mars atmosphere is not polluted. Manufactured goods are then sent down to the martian surface. Elon Musk opens the first Tesla Gigafactory on Mars. Here they recycle solar panel batteries and assemble open and enclosed electric transporters, and also maintain ATVs and other SpaceX transport vehicles. 12 February 2051, Day 8638The year 2051 is known as the second great crossing. The close orbits of earth and Mars allows for another mass movement of people and equipment. Tens of thousands of people land on the red planet. Government officials from different earth nations make the crossing. Mining companies send management teams and exploration geologists to the planet and establish small company habitats. AI robotics and a productive human workforce now makes Mars fully self-sufficient for all essential goods. The colony produces all of its own power, breathable air, water, food and fuel. If resupply missions from earth were to stop, the Mars colony would survive and grow, but in a primitive way as there is still a need for advanced electronics from earth to keep the colony developing as an advanced civilization. 2 April 2053, Day 9418To mark the 10,000 days humans have settled on Mars, the first Mars-born human visits earth. The traveler is assisted by a robotic suit controlled by a neuralink brain chip that helps support them in the heavy earth gravity. On Mars grasslands and woody plants are thriving in vast enclosed greenhouse domes built over melted ice lakes near the equator. They are slowly adding oxygen to the martian atmosphere. The first strands of grass are found growing wild on the martian surface escaped seedlings from the greenhouses are attempting to survive on the surface of Mars.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"英语 English","slug":"英语-English","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD-English/"}]},{"title":"Butterfly Effect 蝴蝶效应","slug":"2021-02-22-22-07-butterfly-effect","date":"2021-02-22T14:07:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.363Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/02/22/2021-02-22-22-07-butterfly-effect/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/02/22/2021-02-22-22-07-butterfly-effect/","excerpt":"The butterfly effect is the idea that small, seemingly trivial events may ultimately result in something with much larger consequences – in other words, they have non-linear impacts on very complex systems.

A time machine company that takes hunters back to the time of dinosaurs and allows them to hunt the T-Rex. The company guarantees nothing, neither your safety nor your return, and there are strict instructions and expectations for how the hunters should behave once they travel back in time. When they travel 60 million years back in time, they noticed the path that has been laid by the company. It floats six inches above the earth, and is the only path that the hunter should travel upon. They cannot touch anything during their stay in the past and they’re only to shoot when told to. Interrupting any of the natural processes in the past could have irreparable repercussions for the future. Step on a mouse and you leave your print, like the Grand Canyon across eternity. They’re very careful with leaving the past just as it was supposed to unfold. The T-Rex that they were supposed to kill was going to be crushed by a tree only seconds later it was going to die anyway. Echols however is terrified and runs back to the time machine through the jungle and waits for the others. But once the rest of the crew returns, they noticed the mud on that goes boots. Against their better judgment they allow him to return with the crew back to prison day. When they exit the time machine the crew checks in with the man behind the desk to see if everything is okay and the man tells him it is. The man however is acting a bit different from before they left there’s a strange smell in the air it’s faint but it’s there. The sign on the wall is different the words were spelled differently. Echols sits down that checks every inch of his body for things that could have ruined, and on his boot caked in the mud he finds a butterfly, beautiful and dead. The death of a single butterfly has somehow resulted in the future being changed, he cries out in this belief, begging to return to the past and somehow undo what he’s done. He sits down, with his eyes closed and senses a crew member enter the room. The crew member briefly and takes the safety off his rifle. Echols opens his eyes, but suddenly all he hears is a sound of thunder. It used to be thought that events that changed the world were things like big bombs, huge earthquakes or other large-scale events. But has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that changed the world are the tiny things. A butterfly flapped its wings in the Amazon and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe. Paraphrased a little bit is a quote from a novel named Good Omens what it’s talking about is the butterfly effect. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions more commonly known as the Butterfly Effect is the idea that a small change in any situation could have huge implications later on down the road. The idea was coined by Edward Lorenz in the 1950s. Lorenz was a meteorologist to a surgery for a means of predicting the weather. He was conducting experiments with various numbers to try and model weather prediction. He did a previous experiment with an initial condition of 0.506127. Six significant digits, a little bit overkill he thought so this time his initial condition was only 0.506. Three significant digits should be fine. So we left the room to get a cup of coffee and came back to something drastically different from what he had previously. At first things seemed normal and they seemed to follow the first experiment one-to-one, but after a while they started to diverge and looked like completely different models. A 0.03% difference in values had enormous long-term implications. It may seem insignificant it’s just a model right. Well, Lorenz had actually just opened the door to a new way of thinking and seeing the world around us. Chaos Theory is the branch of mathematics that focuses on exactly this kind of thinking. But its name is kind of deceiving. Butterfly Effect doesn’t represent chaos but rather the effects of changing the slightest conditions and then observing the results. Think of this it is easier to predict the orbital period of a planet in another star system ten million years from now, than it is for us to predict our own weather here on earth just a month from today. Because in order for us to predict the weather long term, we would have to know the exact position and momentum of every molecule of air on the planet and how they interact with each other. For planetary orbits it’s just a lot easier there’s a lot less of variables, and a university physics student could probably calculate it. As for the weather butterfly flapping his wings creates a minuscule and almost unnoticeable change in atmospheric pressure, but these changes compound over and over and over as time progresses, until as widely known the butterfly’s wings cause tornado in Texas. This inevitable growth of errors is called Deterministic Chaos. Chaos that can be determined measured. However the butterfly itself cannot call as a tornado, the butterfly represents an unknowable quantity. We can never reverse-engineer an event to find out what exactly tipped the system, there’s just too many factors that could have gone into it no choice you’ve ever made has been an isolated event. It’s like a domino effect that keeps compounding over time. The world in society is like a network and when a certain part of that network fails it affects everything else. Chaos Theory isn’t random even though it seems like it. To prove it let’s play Chaos game. Take a piece of paper and make three points like such, we’ll label them A, B and C. Now choose a random point in the middle of those three points, we’ll just put it right here. Now all you have to do is make a point halfway between your starting point and point A, from this point make a point halfway between here and point B, repeat the process for Point C and continue this pattern, rotating between points A, B and C. If you do this for long enough you’ll see something interesting start to happen as more and more generations if these points are drawn an image starts to emerge. From seemingly random points being drawn, from Chaos, from disorder, this complexity yet orderly figure shows its face. From drawing a few points and following certain rules Chaos can form order. It’s a fractal they’re infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across any scale. This shows that with enough time random actions can have serious long-term effects. The Butterfly Effect isn’t exactly how you’d expect science to be. Physics math and many other scientific fields are based on predictability. You know predicting the orbit of planets in order to send satellites of probes there, or predicting the odds of an asteroid hitting the earth. The Butterfly Effect is the complete opposite, it’s a model that exposes the flaws and other models. It says that without a perfect knowledge of initial conditions any prediction is basically useless. But although the Butterfly Effect exposes flaws and other models, it also brings to light the impact that everything including each of us has. Jonas Salk is credited for having found the first vaccines for polio. Had he not discovered that at the time he did, the entire population of the planet today would be vastly different, some people wouldn’t have been born. Entire family lines may have been cut off due to the lack of a vaccine. Perhaps some of the largest companies today would not have been created if it weren’t for this specific event happening at this specific time. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Russian nuclear armed submarines was stationed off the coast of Cuba. American ships detected the submarine and began using depth charges to signal that the submarine should surface. The crew on board though took these depth charges to be bombs, the captain that the ship believed that war had broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union, and ordered a nuclear torpedo to be sent immediately. Everyone agreed except for one officer Vasili arkhipov. Without a unanimous vote no action could be taken and thus World War III was prevented. This one man’s decision is the reason that the United States and Russia today aren’t nuclear wastelands. The Butterfly Effect affects everything. Do you really have control of your life like everything. No, but you and I have huge effects on the world as well. The Butterfly Effect is not to get leverage, it’s not saying that every small thing always has a big impact. If that were true then in a way you couldn’t manipulate it. Think of it like Jenga, you take away a certain block and things can be just fine but another block, that one special block if removed causes everything else to fall apart. The reality is you have no idea what thing or what block will change your future so everything has a say in it. For example you watching this video will take up about 10 minutes of your day, whether it’s for a good reason or not. Could be watching a movie or listening to a song, getting a video idea from it , researching it, writing it, editing it and uploading it to where you see it on your YouTube feed, at a specific time prevent something bad from happening to you. Maybe you watching this video prevented you from going to the store 10 minutes early. Where if you had left 10 minutes ago a car that runs the red light would smash into you in an intersection killing you. It’s a scary thought but it’s a possibility. Someone recently messaged me and said that they had saw someone watching one of my videos in their classroom right next to them. They started to talk become friends and now they’re dating. If YouTube was on a platform if I hadn’t had that specific video idea that wouldn’t have happened, and maybe those two people would have never met. But it goes much further than that, everything has led you and I to this very moment literally everything. Because the universe exists , because the universe is expanding, and because the temperature of the universe was just right to the point that in stellar nurseries can form stars, without those stars we wouldn’t have supernovas, without supernovas we wouldn’t have iron, without iron we couldn’t exist. Every day you breathe I hope and when you exhale you exhale Carbon Dioxide. This Carbon Dioxide through the help of plants and photosynthesis creates more oxygen. Oxygen that people hundreds of years from now might breathe. Everything you do, no matter how small it is will change the future in one way or another. People who lived hundreds of years ago have had an effect on the world as it is today. The things you do today will ripple throughout time. The small things you create today can be the big things that the next generation builds upon, in a way you can live forever. So the next time something big happens in your life, just think it didn’t happen by accident. Just as the Butterfly Effect suggests everything you do today will change your future drastically. Skills you learned today could come in handy in ways you could never expect 10 years from now. Just like the fractals we talked about one small random action can have serious implications down the road.","categories":[{"name":"Chaos","slug":"Chaos","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Chaos/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Immune System 免疫系统","slug":"2021-01-19-10-07-immune-system","date":"2021-01-19T02:07:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.353Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/19/2021-01-19-10-07-immune-system/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/19/2021-01-19-10-07-immune-system/","excerpt":"The immune system is a network of biological processes that protects an organism from diseases.

Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. The immune system protects its host from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. Physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered. We live in a world filled with bacteria, viruses, and other deadly pathogens. In fact, many of them are trying to invade your body right now. If this thought makes you nervous, feel reassured that your body has its own Department of Defense - your immune system. This network works hard round the clock to protect you from harmful invaders. When a pathogen launches an attack, your immune system organizes a beautifully coordinated counter-attack to destroy the pathogen and keep you healthy. Unfortunately, your immune system can make mistakes, including: not destroying diseased or harmful cells (infections and cancer), reacting to non-harmful substances (allergies), or going rogue and attacking your own cells (autoimmune diseases). The immune system is fascinating and complex, and we want to share with you what’s going on in the field of immunology. When a virus enters your body, it will attach itself to one of your cells and inject its DNA or RNA into it. This is like a blueprint for your cells: containing instructions on what the cell has to make. So, in this case, the virus’s RNA will tell your cell to make more copies of the same virus. They become virus factories, pumping out new copies of the virus that can infect even more cells. Naturally, our bodies have a defense system for foreign intruders. The immune system attacks any protein, virus, or bacteria that do not belong in our bodies. But it takes a few days for it to learn how to attack the intruder. Meanwhile, the virus factories are running non-stop, quickly replicating the virus and spreading it in your body. In other words: you start experiencing symptoms of whatever has infected you. After a few days, however, your immune system has figured out how to attack the virus and will start to produce antibodies. These attach themselves to the virus, preventing them from infecting more cells and marking them for destruction. As you can see, the immune system is remarkable, but it’s also slow to mount an attack. That’s the reason why we get sick in the first place. So to give it a helping hand, we developed vaccines. The main idea is to train your immune system to recognize and fight off an infection before it has occurred. Almost like showing your immune system a mug shot of the virus and saying: “if you see this, kill it.” There are various types of vaccines, but let’s take a look at mRNA vaccines, the new kid on the block. To understand how they work, let’s take the COVID19 pandemic as an example. You might have seen pictures of the virus, with its distinctive spikes. These spikes allow the virus to attach to specific cells in your body (ACE2) and infect them. Now here’s the key idea for the COVID19 vaccine: what if we could train our immune system to recognize these spikes by having our body produce them? To do that, researchers took the virus’s blueprint, its RNA, and isolated the part responsible for producing the spikes. Armed with this blueprint, they created mRNA or messenger RNA. This is a special form of RNA that can enter your cells and give them instructions. In this case, the RNA contains instructions to build the spikes of the coronavirus, not the virus itself, just the spikes. So mRNA vaccines contain instructions for your cells that tell them to build a part of a virus in large volumes, almost like giving them a recipe to follow. Once this is happening, your immune system kicks into action and start learning how to attack these intruders. Again, it takes time for the immune system to fight off these spikes, but you won’t get sick because it’s only the spikes, not the virus itself. And that’s it! Your immune system has learned how to attack the spikes of the coronavirus. It destroys all the spikes and even breaks down the mRNA vaccine itself. The only thing left in your body are special “B cells” or memory cells. These can linger around for months or years until the same virus infects you again. When that happens, the B cell can produce the correct antibodies right away, preventing the virus from spreading and making you sick. What’s interesting about this mRNA technique is that it’s relatively quick to develop a vaccine as soon as we know the DNA or RNA sequence of a virus. And secondly, because the vaccine only makes our body produce a part of a virus, we can’t get sick. More traditional vaccines use weakened versions of the actual virus. This also triggers an immune response but could also give you mild symptoms. Now you know how mRNA vaccines work, what about their safety? The biggest misunderstanding about this technology is that the mRNA in the vaccine can enter our cells and changes our very own DNA. But that’s not true. mRNA is very fragile and only survives a few hours in our bodies.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Biology 生物学","slug":"Biology-生物学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Biology-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Respiratory System 呼吸系统","slug":"2021-01-16-13-22-respiratory-system","date":"2021-01-16T05:22:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-15T06:54:04.141Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/16/2021-01-16-13-22-respiratory-system/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/16/2021-01-16-13-22-respiratory-system/","excerpt":"The respiratory system is the organs and other parts of your body involved in breathing,when you exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.

This theory is less conservative than Mohr’s theory since it lies outside Mohr’s boundary. We know that when we apply loads to an object, like this bracket, if we keep increasing the magnitude of the load, at some point the material will fail. But how can we predict when static failure will occur? What level do the stresses in the object need to reach for it to fail? First we need to define what failure is. For ductile materials failure is usually considered to occur at the onset of plastic deformation. And for brittle materials it occurs at fracture. These points are easy to define for a uniaxial stress state, like a tensile test. They occur when the normal stress in the object reaches the yield strength of the material for ductile materials and the ultimate strength for brittle materials. But for a more complex case of tri-axial stress, predicting failure is much less straightforward. In fact it’s so difficult to predict that we don’t have one universally applicable method. Instead, we have to predict failure by selecting the most suitable one of a range of different failure theories, each of which we know works relatively well under certain circumstances, based on experimentation. Because they fail in fundamentally different ways, failure theories which apply for ductile materials usually aren’t applicable for brittle materials, and vice-versa. So what does a failure theory do? It’s quite simple - it allows us to predict failure of a material by comparing the stress state in the object we are assessing with material properties that are easy to determine, like the yield or ultimate strengths of the material, that we can obtain by performing a uniaxial test. The stress state at a point can be described using the three principal stresses, so most failure theories are defined as a function of the principal stresses and the material strength. Probably the simplest failure theory is to say that failure occurs when the maximum or minimum principal stresses reach the yield or ultimate strengths of the material. This is called Maximum Principal Stress theory, or Rankine theory. Although it’s simple to apply, it’s not actually a great failure theory, particularly for ductile materials, for reasons I’ll explain later. Let’s look at some better failure theories for ductile materials. Any good failure theory needs to be consistent with experimental observations we can make about how materials fail. There is one key observation that failure theories for ductile materials need to capture, which is the fact that hydrostatic stresses do not cause yielding in ductile materials. Let me explain. A general tri-axial stress state like the one shown here can be decomposed into stresses which cause a change in volume, and stresses which cause shape distortion. Stresses that cause a change in volume are called hydrostatic stresses, because that is the type of stress acting on an object submerged in liquid. For a hydrostatic stress configuration the three principal stresses are always equal, and there are no shear stresses. For a tri-axial stress state we can calculate the hydrostatic component as the average of the three principal stresses. The mechanism that causes yielding of ductile materials is shear deformation. Since there are no shear stresses for a state of hydrostatic stress, this component can be very large and still not contribute to yielding. Yielding is only caused by the stresses which cause shape distortion. These are called deviatoric stresses. The deviatoric component is calculated by subtracting the hydrostatic component from each of the principal stresses. The hydrostatic and deviatoric components can be expressed in matrix form, like this. Here we have described the stress state using the principal stresses, but we could also describe it for an arbitrary orientation of the stress element. It can be helpful to use Mohr’s circle to understand the hydrostatic and deviatoric components of a tri-axial stress state. For a hydrostatic stress configuration there are no shear stresses, and so Mohr’s circle reduces to a single point, equal to the average of the three principal stresses. Shifting Mohr’s circle horizontally represents an increase in the hydrostatic component. And increasing the radius of Mohr’s circle without changing the average stress represents an increase in the deviatoric component. Since failure of ductile materials only depends on the deviatoric component, a good failure theory for ductile materials should produce the same result regardless of where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. This explains why Maximum Principal Stress theory is not a good failure theory for ductile materials - it isn’t consistent with the observation that yielding is independent of hydrostatic stress. Two failure theories which are consistent with this observation are the Tresca and von Mises failure criteria. These are the two most commonly used failure theories for ductile materials. Let’s start with the Tresca failure criterion, which is also called the maximum shear stress theory. It is named after the French engineer Henri Tresca, and it states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress is equal to the shear stress at yielding in a tensile test. This can be defined mathematically, like this. And graphically using Mohr’s circle, like this. This theory is consistent with the observation that hydrostatic stresses don’t affect yield. It doesn’t care where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. It’s common to express this theory as a function of the principal stresses, instead of as a function of the shear stresses. We can see based on Mohr’s circle for a tri-axial stress state that the maximum shear stress is equal to the radius of the outer circle, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses, divided by 2. Mohr’s circle for a uniaxial tensile test at yielding looks like this. The intermediate and minimum principal stresses 𝞼₂ and 𝞼₃ are equal to zero, and the maximum principal stress 𝞼₁ is equal to the yield strength of the material. The shear stress at yielding is equal to half of the yield strength of the material, so we can re-write our equation to obtain the standard formulation for the Tresca theory. Let’s look at the von Mises failure criterion next, which is also called the maximum distortion energy theory. It was initially developed by the Austrian scientist Richard von Mises, but a number of others were involved in refining it, so it is sometimes called the Maxwell–Huber–Hencky–von Mises theory. It states that yielding occurs when the maximum distortion energy in a material is equal to the distortion energy at yielding in a uniaxial tensile test. So what is the distortion energy? It is essentially the portion of strain energy in a stressed element corresponding to the effect of the deviatoric stresses. The distortion energy per unit volume can be calculated from the principal stresses using this equation. We know that at yielding during a tensile test the maximum principal stress is equal to the yield strength of the material, and the two other principal stresses are equal to zero. So we can calculate the distortion energy at yielding in a tensile test by plugging in the appropriate principal stress values. And by equating the distortion energy at yielding with the general equation for a tri-axial stress state, and re-arranging a bit, we get an equation that defines the von Mises failure criterion. Again we can see that this theory considers the difference between principal stresses, and so is independent of the hydrostatic stress. The term on the left is often called the equivalent von Mises stress. If it is larger than the yield strength of the material, yielding is predicted to have occurred. The equivalent von Mises stress is a common output from stress analysis performed using the finite element method. Contour plots are typically generated to show the distribution of the von Mises equivalent stress within a component, as these allow areas at risk of yielding to be identified. When comparing failure theories it can be useful to plot their yield surfaces. A yield surface is the representation of a failure theory in the principal stress space, which sounds more complicated than it actually is. To keep things simple let’s start by considering a plane stress case, where one of the three principal stresses is equal to zero. By convention principal stresses are ordered from largest to smallest, like this, but since we don’t know yet how the stresses will be ordered, I’ll refer to them as 𝞼A, 𝞼B, and 𝞼C instead. We’ll say that 𝞼C is equal to zero, and so the two axes of our yield surface graph correspond to the two non-zero principal stresses, 𝞼A and 𝞼B. The yield surface for the Maximum Principal Stress theory is easy to plot - it says that yielding begins when either of these principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material, so it looks like this. Yielding is considered to have occurred when the stress state reaches this line. Next let’s plot the yield surface for the Tresca theory. This theory states that yielding occurs when the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material. But it’s not as simple as taking the difference between 𝞼A and 𝞼B. Plane stress is still a three-dimensional stress state. In the top right quadrant of the graph both 𝞼A and 𝞼B are positive, and so 𝞼C, which is equal to zero, is the minimum principal stress. The yield surface looks like this. But in the bottom right quadrant 𝞼B is negative, and so 𝞼B is the minimum principal stress. That gives us a yield surface that looks like this. Repeating this process for the other two quadrants completes the Tresca yield surface. von Mises yield theory for plane stress conditions is defined using this equation when expressed in terms of the principal stresses. We can square both sides of the equation and see that it is of the same form as an ellipse, which gives us the von Mises yield surface. Let’s plot some experimental data for tests performed on ductile materials and see how each of these theories compares. It’s clear that the Maximum Principal Stress theory has large areas where its use is potentially unsafe. So let’s get rid of it, and compare Tresca and von Mises. Both agree well with experimental observations, although von Mises agrees slightly better. The Tresca yield surface lies entirely inside the von Mises surface, meaning that Tresca is more conservative. If we assume that the principal stresses will increase in proportion to one another as a load is applied, and so the stress paths are straight lines, the difference between the Tresca and von Mises theories is largest for these three configurations. The maximum difference between the two theories can be calculated to be 15.5%. von Mises is usually preferred to Tresca because it agrees better with experimental data, but Tresca is sometimes used because it is easier to apply and it is more conservative. So far we have looked at a plane stress case, with 𝞼C equal to zero. But for a general three-dimensional stress state, 𝞼C will be non-zero. We know that the Tresca and von Mises yield surfaces aren’t affected by hydrostatic stresses, and so to obtain the yield surfaces in three dimensions we just need to extend the plane stress yield surfaces along the hydrostatic axis. Failure of brittle materials is different to failure of ductile materials. For brittle materials, failure is considered to occur by fracture rather than yielding. And unlike ductile materials, brittle materials tend to have compressive strengths that are much larger than their tensile strengths. This needs to be captured in any failure theory for brittle materials. It also means that to assess failure of brittle materials we need to know two separate ultimate strengths, for tension and for compression. Coulomb-Mohr theory is a failure theory often used for brittle materials. Unlike the theories we have seen for ductile materials, it considers failure to be sensitive to hydrostatic stresses, and captures the difference between tensile and compressive ultimate strengths. The easiest way to define this theory is using Mohr’s circle. We start by drawing the Mohr’s circles corresponding to failure in the uniaxial tensile and compressive tests. By drawing lines tangent to both circles we create a failure envelope. Coulomb-Mohr theory states that a material will fail for a stress-state with a Mohr’s circle that reaches this envelope. The Tresca yield criterion we saw earlier is actually a special case of the Coulomb-Mohr failure theory, where we have the same material properties in tension and in compression. The plane stress failure surface for Coulomb-Mohr theory looks like this. As you can see it doesn’t agree particularly well with experimental data in the bottom right quadrant. Modified Mohr theory is a slight variation on the theory, which better fits experimental data. It is one of the preferred general failure theories for brittle materials. Because failure theories for brittle materials need to account for the effect of hydrostatic stresses, these failure theories converge to a point when extended along the hydrostatic axis. And that’s it for this introduction to failure theories! We’ve covered the most common theories, but there are many more out there which may be more appropriate for specific scenarios.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Riemann Hypothesis 黎曼猜想","slug":"2021-01-07-06-23-riemann-hypothesis","date":"2021-01-06T22:23:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.348Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/07/2021-01-07-06-23-riemann-hypothesis/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/07/2021-01-07-06-23-riemann-hypothesis/","excerpt":"Riemann hypothesis, in number theory, hypothesis by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann concerning the location of solutions to the Riemann zeta function, which is connected to the prime number theorem and has important implications for the distribution of prime numbers.

The solution for each Millennium Problem is worth $1 million.In 2008 the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) listed it as one of the DARPA Mathematical Challenges, 23 mathematical problems for which it was soliciting research proposals for funding — “Mathematical Challenge Nineteen: Settle the Riemann Hypothesis.

At any particular point, the amount flowing in is the same as the amount flowing out, so at every point the “outflowing-ness” of the field is zero. Therefore, we expect the divergence of both fields to be zero, and this is indeed the case, as $$\\text{div}(\\langle 1,2 \\rangle ) &#x3D; \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (1) + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2) &#x3D; 0$$ and $$\\text{div}(\\langle -y,x \\rangle ) &#x3D; \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (-y) + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x) &#x3D; 0.$$ Figure 1: (a) Vector field ⟨1, 2⟩ has zero divergence. (b) Vector field ⟨−𝑦, 𝑥⟩ also has zero divergence. By contrast, consider radial vector field $\\vec{R}(x, y)&#x3D;\\langle-x,-y\\rangle$ in Figure 2. At any given point, more fluid is flowing in than is flowing out, and therefore the “outgoingness” of the field is negative. We expect the divergence of this field to be negative, and this is indeed the case, as $$\\operatorname{div}(\\vec{R})&#x3D;\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-x)+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-y)&#x3D;-2$$ Figure 2: This vector field has negative divergence. To get a global sense of what divergence is telling us, suppose that a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ represents the velocity of a fluid. Imagine taking an elastic circle (a circle with a shape that can be changed by the vector field) and dropping it into a fluid. If the circle maintains its exact area as it flows through the fluid, then the divergence is zero. This would occur for both vector fields in Figure 1. On the other hand, if the circle’s shape is distorted so that its area shrinks or expands, then the divergence is not zero. Imagine dropping such an elastic circle into the radial vector field in Figure 2 so that the center of the circle lands at point (3, 3). The circle would flow toward the origin, and as it did so the front of the circle would travel more slowly than the back, causing the circle to “scrunch” and lose area. This is how you can see a negative divergence. CurlThe second operation on a vector field that we examine is the curl, which measures the extent of rotation of the field about a point. Suppose that $\\vec{F}$ represents the velocity field of a fluid. Then, the curl of $\\vec{F}$ at point $P$ is a vector that measures the tendency of particles near $P$ to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of this vector. The magnitude of the curl vector at $P$ measures how quickly the particles rotate around this axis. In other words, the curl at a point is a measure of the vector field’s “spin” at that point. Visually, imagine placing a paddlewheel into a fluid at $P$ , with the axis of the paddlewheel aligned with the curl vector (Figure 3). The curl measures the tendency of the paddlewheel to rotate. Figure 3: To visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a small paddlewheel into the vector field at a point. Consider the vector fields in Figure 1. In part (a), the vector field is constant and there is no spin at any point. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be zero, and this is indeed the case. Part (b) shows a rotational field, so the field has spin. In particular, if you place a paddlewheel into a field at any point so that the axis of the wheel is perpendicular to a plane, the wheel rotates counterclockwise. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be nonzero, and this is indeed the case (the curl is $2,\\mathbf{\\hat k}$). To see what curl is measuring globally, imagine dropping a leaf into the fluid. As the leaf moves along with the fluid flow, the curl measures the tendency of the leaf to rotate. If the curl is zero, then the leaf doesn’t rotate as it moves through the fluid. Definition: CurlIf $\\vec{F} &#x3D; \\langle P,Q,R \\rangle$ is a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $P_x, , Q_y,$ and $R_z$ all exist, then the curl of $\\vec{F}$ is defined by $$\\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{curl} \\vec{F} &amp;&#x3D;\\left(\\boldsymbol{R}{y}-Q{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}+\\left(\\boldsymbol{P}{z}-\\boldsymbol{R}{x}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(Q_{x}-\\boldsymbol{P}_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\&amp;&#x3D;\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{R}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{y}}-\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{P}}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{R}}{\\partial x}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{P}}{\\partial y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\end{aligned}$$ Note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field, in contrast to divergence. The definition of curl can be difficult to remember. To help with remembering, we use the notation $\\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\vec{F}$ to stand for a “determinant” that gives the curl formula: $$\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}\\hat{i} &amp; \\hat{j} &amp; \\hat{k} \\\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} &amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\P &amp; Q &amp; R\\end{array}\\right|.$$ The determinant of this matrix is $$\\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}-\\left(R_{x}-P_{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}+\\left(P_{z}-R_{x}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\\operatorname{curl} \\vec{F}.$$ Thus, this matrix is a way to help remember the formula for curl. Keep in mind, though, that the word determinant is used very loosely. A determinant is not really defined on a matrix with entries that are three vectors, three operators, and three functions. If $\\vec{F} &#x3D; \\langle P,Q \\rangle$ is a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ , then the curl of $\\vec{F}$ , by definition, is $$\\operatorname{curl} \\vec{F}&#x3D;\\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$$","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Antenna 天线","slug":"2021-01-06-23-53-antenna","date":"2021-01-06T15:53:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T15:01:10.842Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-53-antenna/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-53-antenna/","excerpt":"Antennas are widely used in the field of telecommunications and we know many applications for them.

The length of the metal patch should be half of the wavelength for proper transmission and reception. Antennas are widely used in the field of telecommunications, and we have already seen many applications for them in this video series. Antennas receive an electromagnetic wave and convert it to an electric signal, or receive an electric signal and radiate it as an electromagnetic wave. In this video, we are going to look at the science behind antennas. We have an electric signal, so how do we convert it to an electromagnetic wave? You might have a simple answer in your mind. That is to use a closed conductor and with the help of the principle of electromagnetic induction, you will be able to produce a fluctuating magnetic field and an electric field around it. However, this fluctuating field around the source is of no use in transmitting signals. The electromagnetic field here does not propagate, instead, it just fluctuates around the source. In an antenna, the electromagnetic waves need to be separated from the source and they should propagate. Before looking at how an antenna is made, let’s understand the physics behind the wave separation. Consider one positive and one negative charge placed a distance apart. This arrangement is known as a dipole, and they obviously produce an electric field as shown. Now, assume that these charges are oscillating as shown, at the midpoint of their path, the velocity will be at the maximum and at the ends of their paths the velocity will be zero. The charged particles undergo continuous acceleration and deceleration due to this velocity variation. The challenge now is to find out how the electric field varies due to this movement. Let’s concentrate on only one electric field line. The wavefront formed at time zero expands and is deformed as shown after one eighth of a time period. This is surprising. You might’ve expected a simple electric field as shown at this location. Why has the electric field stretched and formed a field like this? This is because the accelerating or decelerating charges produce an electric field with some memory effects. The old electric field does not easily adjust to the new condition. We need to spend some time to understand this memory effect of the electric field or kink generation of accelerating or decelerating charges. We will discuss this interesting topic in more detail in a separate video. If we continue our analysis in the same manner, we can see that at one quarter of a time period, the wavefront ends meet at a single point. After this, the separation and propagation of the Wavefront happens. Please note that this varying electric field will automatically generate a varying magnetic field perpendicular to it. If you draw electric field intensity variation with the distance, you can see that the wave propagation is sinusoidal in nature. It is interesting to note that the wavelength of the propagation so produced is exactly double that of the length of the dipole. We will come back to this point later. This is exactly what we need in an antenna. In short, we can make an antenna if we can make an arrangement for oscillating the positive and negative charges. In practice, the production of such an oscillating charge, is very easy. Take a conducting rod with a bend in its center, and apply a voltage signal at the center. Assume this is the signal you have applied, a time-varying voltage signal. Consider the case at time zero. Due to the effect of the voltage, the electrons will be displaced from the right of the dipole and will be accumulated on the left. This means the other end which has lost electrons automatically becomes positively charged. This arrangement has created the same effect as the previous dipole charge case, that is positive and negative charges at the end of a wire. With the variation of voltage with time, the positive and negative charges will shuttle to and fro. The simple dipole antenna also produces the same phenomenon we saw in the previous section and wave propagation occurs. We have now seen how the antenna works as a transmitter. The frequency of the transmitted signal will be the same as the frequency of the applied voltage signal. Since the propagation travels at the speed of light, we can easily calculate the wavelength of the propagation. For perfect transmission, the length of the antenna should be half of the wavelength. The operation of the antenna is reversible and it can work as a receiver if a propagating electromagnetic field hits it. Let’s see this phenomenon in detail. Take the same antenna again and apply an electric field. At this instant, the electrons will accumulate at one end of the rod. This is the same as an electric dipole. As the applied electric field varies, the positive and negative charges accumulate at the other ends. The varying charge accumulation means a varying electric voltage signal is produced at the center of the antenna. This voltage signal is the output when the antenna works as a receiver. The frequency of the output voltage signal is the same as the frequency of the receiving EM wave. It is clear from the electric field configuration that for perfect reception, the size of the antenna should be half of the wavelength. In all these discussions, we have seen that the antenna is an open circuit. Now let’s see a few practical antennas and how they work. In the past, dipole antennas were used for TV reception. The colored bar acts as a dipole and receives the signal. A reflector and director are also needed in this kind of antenna to focus the signal on the dipole. This complete structure is known as a Yagi-Uda antenna. The dipole antenna converted the received signal into electrical signals, and these electrical signals were carried by coaxial cable to the television unit. Nowadays we have moved to dish TV antennas. These consists of two main components, a parabolic shaped reflector and the low-noise block downconverter. The parabolic dish receives electromagnetic signals from the satellite and focuses them onto the LNBF. The shape of the parabolic is very specifically and accurately designed. The LNBF is made up of a feedhorn, a waveguide, a PCB, and a probe. In this animation, you can see how the incoming signals are focused onto the probe via the feedhorn and waveguide. At the probe, voltage is induced as we saw in the simple dipole case. The voltage signal so generated is fed to a PCB for signal processing such as filtration, conversion from high to low frequency and amplification. After signal processing, these electrical signals are carried down to the television unit through a coaxial cable. If you open up an LNB, you will most probably find two probes instead of one. The second probe being perpendicular to the first one. The two probe arrangement means the available spectrum can be used twice by sending the waves with either horizontal or vertical polarization. One probe detects the horizontally polarized signal and the other, the vertically polarized signal. The cell phone in your hand uses a completely different type of antenna called a patch antenna. A patch antenna consists of a metallic patch or strip placed on a ground plane with a piece of dielectric material in between. Here, the metallic patch acts as a radiating element. The length of the metal patch should be half of the wavelength for proper transmission and reception.","categories":[{"name":"Radio","slug":"Radio","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Radio/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Electromagnetic Radiation 电磁辐射","slug":"2021-01-06-23-43-electromagnetic-radiation","date":"2021-01-06T15:43:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-15T06:53:37.969Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-43-electromagnetic-radiation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-43-electromagnetic-radiation/","excerpt":"In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space, carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. In the modern world, we humans are completely surrounded by electromagnetic radiation. Have you ever thought of the physics behind these traveling electromagnetic waves? The great scientist, Heinrich Hertz, was the first man to transmit and detect electromagnetic waves. In his famous experiment, a high voltage current was applied to the two ends of two metal wires, which generated a spark in the gap between them. This spark resulted in the radiation of electromagnetic waves. Those electromagnetic waves traveled through the air and created a spark in a metal coil located over a meter away. If you had placed an LED in that gap, the bulb would have glowed. This was a clear case of electromagnetic wave propagation and detection. However, before Hertz, the brilliant mathematician, James clerk Maxwell, had already laid out the foundations for electromagnetic radiation by formulating for mathematical equations. However, these equations and the Hertz experiment raised a question, how do electromagnetic fields detach themselves from wires and propagate through a space? More specifically, what we need is a traveling electromagnetic wave and not a fluctuating one. Let’s explore this logically. Consider an electric charge, which is moving at a constant speed. The electric field around it is shown. Now imagine for a fraction of a second it accelerates after that, it continues its uniform motion at a higher speed. What we need to understand is the effect of this acceleration on the electric field. The interesting thing is that the information does not travel at an infinite speed, instead, it travels at the speed of light. Similarly, the information about the sudden variation of velocity of the charge does not get conveyed to the whole electric field region. The field near it knows about it, but the field far away still has no idea that the charge has accelerated and it is still in the old state. Let’s separate out these regions with the help of two circles. Since the electric field cannot break the field between these distances must transition. This transition field is known as a kink. The kink moves or radiates outwards at the speed of light. To show the kink animation in a clear way, let’s move the camera along with the charge. We can say here that the acceleration of the charge has caused an electromagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic radiation. Based on this understanding, we will be able to understand the most important experiment in the field of antenna technology, the oscillating electric dipole. The interesting fact about this simple oscillating dipole is that it produces electromagnetic radiation in a perfectly sinusoidal manner. Let’s see how it is achieved. Before getting into the electromagnetics, let’s understand how velocity and acceleration vary in this simple case. It is clear that at both ends the velocities should be zero and in the middle the velocity should be at the maximum. This means that this is a case of continuous acceleration and deceleration. The electric field pattern is drawn here when the chargers are far apart, and when the velocity is zero. In order to have a better understanding, let’s examine one of the electric field lines. Let’s observe the electric field line at t by eight. You can see that the electric field line is deformed. The reason for this deformation is simple. This time period is the region with the highest acceleration. As we saw earlier, accelerating or decelerating charges cause kinks in the electric field. In short, the old electric field does not get adjusted to the new field very well. This deformation is continuous since there is continuous acceleration in the charge. When two charges meet at the central point, the deformed line also meets there. After that, it detaches and radiates. This radiation travels at the speed of light. If you applied an electric field intensity variation with respect to length, you can see that the radiation we have produced is perfectly sinusoidal in nature. Please note that this varying electric field will automatically generate a varying magnetic field perpendicular to it. Now let’s have a look at how this applies to an antenna. A time varying voltage is applied to the metal wire is shown due to the effect of the voltage the electrons will be displaced from right to left and create positive and negative charges. With a continuous variation of voltage, the positive and negative charges will shuttle back and forth in the wire. The simple arrangement is known as a dipole antenna. The dipole antenna produces the same radiation as we saw in the previous section. In this case, the antenna works as a transmitter. The frequency of the transmitted signal will be the same as the frequency of the applied voltage signal. The same antenna can act as a receiver if the operation of the antenna is reversed. When propagating electromagnetic waves strike the antenna, the oscillating fields of waves create positive and negative charges at the ends of the antenna. The varying charge accumulation means a varying voltage signal is produced at the center of the antenna. This voltage signal is the output when the antenna works as a receiver. We can note here that for perfect transmission or reception, the length of the antenna should be half of the wavelength. This is the first antenna design criteria for proper reception or transmission. The second most important design criteria is a term called impedance matching. Perfect impedance matching will make sure that the waves are radiated in the most efficient way. When an alternating current passes through a circuit, it faces opposition from the combined effects of resistance, inductance and capacitance. This combined effect is known as impedance. According to the maximum power transfer theorem, to transfer the maximum amount of power the load impedance should match with the source impedance. For further understanding, let’s take an example of a circuit containing an alternator as a source and a motor bulb, et cetera, as a load. In this setup to achieve maximum power transfer from alternator to the load, the impedance of the load must match with the impedance of the alternator. A similar impedance balance is required in the case of an antenna system. Since an antenna works on high frequency signals, the impedance of the transmission lines also becomes important. Hence to achieve maximum power, the impedance of an antenna should match to the impedance of the source and transmission line as well. If the impedances do not match, some portion of the power would be reflected back to the source instead of radiating outwards from the antenna. A free space has an impedance value of 377 ohms. In a parabolic antenna, a wave guide is used as a transmission line, which has a different impedance value from the free space. That’s why a feedhorn is also included in a parabolic antenna. This way, the impedance of the wave guide is matched with the impedance of the free space so that the EM waves can be received properly.","text":"In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space, carrying electromagnetic radiant energy.

Enjoy these colored pencil techniques &amp; tips, perfect for beginners or artists new to colored pencil drawing and painting. Shading: produced with an even, side-to-side stroke that creates a smooth even layer of color; a light touch will deposit a faint amount of color for graduated colored pencil shading. Hatching: a series of evenly spaced, parallel lines that leave a little white or color of the underlying surface visible; hatching in colored pencil adds texture to your compositions. Cross-hatching: hatching overlaid at an angle to build up layers of color or value; keep the pencil tips sharp to create fine, even lines. Burnishing: layers of colored pencil applied with strong, even pressure so the colors blend or intermix, completely covering the paper with a smooth solid color; a stump or tortillion or a smooth metal tool rubbed with even, heavy pressure in a circular motion against a deposit of color will also burnish the color. Burnish light-colored areas first. Blending: produced by applying heavy, even pressure with a pigmentless blending pencil or a white or light-colored pencil (such as cream or light gray), creating slick, evenly blended color; a stiff bristle brush can be used to blend colors as well. Colored pencil blending techniques can help add depth to your colored pencil drawings. Burnishing or blending with pale ochre creates an aged or antique look for metallic surfaces. Alternatively, you can use cloud blue to suggest atmospheric perspective. A colorless marker can also be used to blend layers of color together. Permanent markers are good for making washes or underpaintings in colored pencil drawings. Scumbling: an irregular or broken deposit of one color over another allowing the underlying color to be visible through the top layer. Solvent effects: using a solvent such as mineral spirits — applied with a cotton swab or brush — softens the colored pencil deposit and creates a wide range of interesting colored pencil effects. MUST-HAVE COLORED PENCIL TOOLS Colored Pencil Tools | Drawing with Colored PencilsGood sharpener: A good quality hand-held sharpener is a must; an electric sharpener saves time and energy. Colorless blender: A colored pencil with a core made of pigmentless wax can be used to blend colors or soften edges without adding more color. Erasers: White plastic erasers will remove or manipulate colored pencil marks; eraser pencils and sticks are useful for concise erasure. Eraser shields: This small, flat metal tool with openings of various shapes can be used for precise, controlled erasure. Cotton swabs: These can be used for burnishing or for applying solvents. Knives: Use these or other sharp instruments for sgraffito. Spray workable fixative: Use fixative to protect a finished drawing and prevent wax blooms. Sturdy storage box: Keep your pencils orderly and protected.","categories":[{"name":"Drawing","slug":"Drawing","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Drawing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Art 艺术","slug":"Art-艺术","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Art-%E8%89%BA%E6%9C%AF/"}]},{"title":"Inception 盗梦空间","slug":"2020-12-30-22-03-inception","date":"2020-12-30T14:03:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.339Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/30/2020-12-30-22-03-inception/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/30/2020-12-30-22-03-inception/","excerpt":"","text":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.

So much of the modern technology that we have today such as wireless communication, GPS and in fact anything related to the vast field of signal processing relies on the insights of the FFT. But it’s also one of the most beautiful albums you’ll ever see. The depth and sheer number of brilliant ideas that went into it is just astounding it’s easy to miss the beauty aspect of the FFT since it’s often introduced in fairly complex settings that require a lot of prerequisite knowledge such as the discrete fourier transform time domain to frequency domain conversions and much more. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient $O(N \\log N)$ algorithm for calculating DFTs. The FFT exploits symmetries in the $W$ matrix to take a “divide and conquer” approach. We will first discuss deriving the actual FFT algorithm, some of its implications for the DFT, and a speed comparison to drive home the importance of this powerful algorithm. To derive the FFT, we assume that the signal’s duration is a power of two: $N&#x3D;2^l$ . Consider what happens to the even-numbered and odd-numbered elements of the sequence in the DFT calculation. $$\\begin{align}S(k) &amp;&#x3D;s(0)+s(2) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi 2 k}{N}}+\\ldots+s(N-2) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi(N-2) k}{N}}+s(1) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi k}{N}}+s(3) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi \\times (2+1) k}{N}}+\\ldots+s(N-1) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi(N-2+1) k}{N}} \\nonumber \\ &amp;&#x3D;s(0)+s(2)e^{(-j)\\frac{2\\pi k}{\\frac{N}{2}}} + \\ldots + s(N-2)e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi\\left(\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right) k}{\\frac{N}{2}}} +\\left( s(1)+s(3) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi k}{\\frac{N}{2}}}+\\dots+s(N-1) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi\\left(\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right) k}{\\frac{N}{2}}}\\right) e^{\\frac{-(j 2 \\pi k)}{N}} \\end{align}$$ Each term in square brackets has the form of a $\\frac{N}{2}$ -length DFT. The first one is a DFT of the even-numbered elements, and the second of the odd-numbered elements. The first DFT is combined with the second multiplied by the complex exponential $e^{\\frac{-(j 2\\pi k)}{N}}$. The half-length transforms are each evaluated at frequency indices $k \\in{0, \\ldots, N-1}$. Normally, the number of frequency indices in a DFT calculation range between zero and the transform length minus one. The computational advantage of the FFT comes from recognizing the periodic nature of the discrete Fourier transform. The FFT simply reuses the computations made in the half-length transforms and combines them through additions and the multiplication by $e^{\\frac{-(j 2 \\pi k)}{N}}$, which is not periodic over $\\frac{N}{2}$, to rewrite the length-N DFT. The formula above illustrates this decomposition. As it stands, we now compute two length-$\\frac{N}{2}$ transforms (complexity $2 O\\left(\\frac{N^{2}}{4}\\right)$), multiply one of them by the complex exponential (complexity $O(N)$), and add the results (complexity $O(N)$). At this point, the total complexity is still dominated by the half-length DFT calculations, but the proportionality coefficient has been reduced. Now for the fun. Because $N&#x3D;2^l$, each of the half-length transforms can be reduced to two quarter-length transforms, each of these to two eighth-length ones, etc. This decomposition continues until we are left with length-2 transforms. This transform is quite simple, involving only additions. Thus, the first stage of the FFT has $\\frac{N}{2}$length-2 transforms (see the bottom part of fomula). Pairs of these transforms are combined by adding one to the other multiplied by a complex exponential. Each pair requires 4 additions and 4 multiplications, giving a total number of computations equaling $8\\frac{N}{4}&#x3D;\\frac{N}{2}$. This number of computations does not change from stage to stage. Because the number of stages, the number of times the length can be divided by two, equals $\\log_2 N$, the complexity of the FFT is $O(N \\log N)$. The initial decomposition of a length-8 DFT into the terms using even- and odd-indexed inputs marks the first phase of developing the FFT algorithm. When these half-length transforms are successively decomposed, we are left with the diagram shown in the bottom panel that depicts the length-8 FFT computation. 法国数学家傅里叶提出，任何周期函数都可表示为不同频率的正弦函数和，或余弦函数之和，其中每个正弦函数和，或余弦函数都要乘以不同的系数，这个和就称为傅里叶级数。 DFT 是指 Discrete Fourier Transform，离散傅里叶变换。 FFT 是指 快速傅里叶变换，它是 DFT 的一种简化计算。它是根据离散傅氏变换的奇、偶、虚、实等特性，对离散傅立叶变换的算法进行改进获得的。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Baduk 围棋入门

先手官和逆收官一方走是先手，一方走是后手，先手的一方叫先手官，后手的一方叫逆收官。先手官和逆收官往往是同一个官子，大小也一样，只是称呼的对象不一样而已。先手和逆收官可以简单的理解为两倍后手官的价值。 后手官无论谁下都是后手，即双方都是后手时，称为后手官。也可以理解为双方后手官的简称。当我们一般说官子的价值时，默认都是按后手官来理解的。例如说这个地方的官子是两目，指的就是双方后手两目。","categories":[{"name":"Baduk","slug":"Baduk","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Baduk/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Sports

收官阶段也称为官子阶段。然而，这三个阶段之间并没有明显的界限，何时进入中盘，何时进入收官，完全取决于棋局的发展和对局者的决断。围棋中盘战术的主要技术，除了包括计算能力、掌控全局能力和形势判断之外，还包括进攻、防守、手筋、死活、打入、侵消等多方面的战术。

的围棋入门视频。主要内容：课程简介、认识围棋、“气”的概念、“死”与“活”、棋局的胜负。 简介围棋的棋具 棋盘：棋盘由纵横各十九条等距离、垂直交叉的平行线构成。形成361个交叉点，在围棋中简称为“点”。棋盘整体形状以及每个格子纵、横向相比，横向稍短，通常为每格2.4厘米×2.3厘米。在棋盘上标有九个小圆点，称作“星”。中央的圆点又称“天元”。 棋子：棋子分黑白两色，形状为扁圆形体。棋子的数量应能保证顺利终局。正式比赛以黑白各180子为宜。 围棋的下法 对局双方各执一色棋子。 空枰开局。 黑先白后，交替着一子于棋盘的点上。 棋子下定后，不再向其他点移动。 轮流下子是双方的权利，但允许任何一方放弃下子权而使用虚着。 棋子的气一个棋子在棋盘上，与它直线紧邻的空点是这个棋子的“气”。直线紧邻的点上如果有同色棋子存在，这些棋子就相互连接成一个不可分割的整体。直线紧邻的点上如果有异色棋子存在，此处的气便不存在。棋子如失去所有的气，就不能在棋盘上存在。 提子把无气之子清理出棋盘的手段叫“提子”。提子有二种： 下子后，对方棋子无气，应立即提取对方无气之子。 下子后，双方棋子都呈无气状态，应立即提取对方无气之子。 禁着点棋盘上的任何一点，如某方下子后，该子立即呈无气状态，同时又不能提取对方的棋子。这个点叫做“禁着点”。 禁止全局同形着子后不得使对方重复面临曾出现过的局面。 终局 棋局下到双方一致确认着子完毕时，为终局。 对局中有一方中途认输时，为终局。 双方连续使用虚着，为终局。 活棋与死棋 终局时，经双方确认，不能被提取的棋都是活棋。 终局时，经双方确认，能被提取的棋都是死棋。 计算胜负着子完毕的棋局，采用数子法计算胜负。将双方死子清理出盘外后，对任意一方的活棋和活棋围住的点以子为单位进行计数。双方活棋之间的空点各得一半。棋盘总点数的一半 180.5 点为归本数。一方总得点数超过此数为胜，等于此数为和，小于此数为负。 先后手的确定对局的先后手，由大会抽签编排或对局前猜先决定。竞赛规程对此应作明确表述。猜先的顺序是：先由高段者握若干白子暂不示人。低段者出示一颗黑子，表示“奇数则己方执黑，反之执白”，出示两颗黑子则表示“偶数则己方执黑，反之执白”。高段者公示手握白子之数，先后手自然确定。双方段位相同时，由年长者握子。 贴子正式比赛采用黑棋贴子制度，终局计算胜负时，黑棋贴还 3又3&#x2F;4 子，也就是说黑棋要有 180.5 + 3.75 &#x3D; 184.25 子以上才能赢棋。例如黑方总共得 185 子则黑胜 3&#x2F;4 子，得 184 子则黑负 1&#x2F;4 子。 （中国规则中1988年开始实行黑棋贴二又四分之三子的规则，2001年改为黑棋贴三又四分之三子。） 术语基本概念 气：在棋盘上，棋子与它直线紧紧相邻的空交叉点，就是这个棋子的“气”。单独一个棋子的气数不超过四气，但两个或两个以上相连的棋子则可以有四气以上。棋子若失去所有的气，就成为死棋，不能在棋盘上存在。 目：棋盘上，被一方棋子所围地域的空白交叉点，称之为“目”。一个交叉点即是1目，目的数量称为“目数”。 空：用棋子围成的地域。 地：（1）即地域或空。指已为某方占有的地区。（2）形势判断用语。如“黑地六十目”，即指黑方可望在全局围有六十目的地域。（3）指占有子和“空”的总和。即棋子围有的全部交叉点。 活棋：所包围的目数和活棋本身之总和，称为“地”。 提子：将对方无气的棋子从棋盘上取下，称为“提子”。 打劫：双方可以轮流提取对方棋子的情况。围棋规则规定，打劫时，被提取的一方不能直接提回，必须在其他地方找劫材使对方应一手之后方可提回。 真眼：由几个连接在一起的棋子围住一个或两个空交叉点，则称该点为真眼，简称“眼”。 假眼：由几个没有完全连接的棋子围成了眼的形状，称为“假眼” 。在一定条件下，围成假眼的棋子会被对方吃掉。 活棋：棋盘上凡是对方无法提取的棋即是活棋。活棋通常要具备两只真眼。 死棋：棋盘上迟早能被对方提取的棋，即为死棋。死棋不具有两只真眼。 公活：双方互围的棋子均无两只眼，但又不能制杀对方时即为公活，也称“双活”。 禁着点：棋盘任一点，一方下子后，该棋子即呈无气状态，同时又不能提取对方的棋子，这个点就称为该方的“禁着点”。一方不能下子的禁着点，对方可以下子。 布局：布局是一盘棋的先导，也是双方进行阵容部署、各自抢占要点，为双方接触作战作准备的阶段。 定式：是指布局阶段双方在角部的争夺中，按照一定的行棋次序，选择比较合理的着法，最终形成双方大体安定、利益大体均等的棋本棋形。定式的种类有星定式、小目定式、三三定式、目外定式、高目定式等。 中盘：也称为中局，指双方在布局之后从短兵相接开始进行的全局性作战阶段。 收官：是指中盘作战基本结束，双方所占地域已经大致确定，进而使双方属地完全明确的一系列着法。 位置 星：在棋盘坐标4·四的位置和棋盘正中央标有九个小圆点，术语称为“星”。这九颗星，将棋盘大致划分为左上角、右上角、左下角、右下角、上边、下边、左边、右边和中腹九个区域。 角：指棋盘四个角部星位内侧的区域。 边：指棋盘四个边星两侧的区域。 天元：棋盘正中央的一颗星称作“天元”。 中腹：天元周围的区域称为中腹。 小目：棋盘坐标 3·四 的位置称作“小目”。 高目：棋盘坐标 4·五 的位置称作“高目”。 目外：棋盘坐标 3·五 的位置称作“目外”。 三三：棋盘坐标 3·三 的位置称为“三三”。 急所：指对局时，急需抢占的要点之处，无固定位置。 大场：指布局时，棋盘上下子后能够开拆或分投之处。 天王山：“天王山”一词是指在布局阶段，双方大模样（势力）的消涨要点，表示盘面中双方都应抢占的重要的位置。","text":"胡翼飞

挂：布局时，在一方有一子占据角部时，另一方在其附近间隔一路或二路的位置行棋，称作“挂”。在三线行棋，称为低挂，在四线行棋，称为高挂。根据双方棋子的相对位置，又可分为一间高挂、二间高挂、一间低挂、二间低挂和小飞挂、大飞挂等。挂的目的在于破坏或侵占对方所占的角部。 缔：也称为“缔角”或“守角”。指在己方原有小目、高目或目外一子的基础上，再下一着棋，使己方两个子相互配合守角的着法。缔角既有利于围占角地，又可进一步控制和开拓边上的大场，是布局阶段常采用的着法。 长：双方棋子紧贴着向同一方向行棋，先行的一方，棋子会始终高出对方一头。长的着法能将己方的棋子连接成一个整体，这样可以延长棋子的气，既可以防止对方的攻击，又便于伺机攻击对方。 立：紧靠着己方原有的棋子，竖着向边线方向下一子的着法。通常多指在二线或三线的行棋。 尖：在原有棋子的斜线上下一子。由于尖的步子较小，也称其为“小尖”。在实战中，尖是一种攻守兼备的下法，既能够保持两子间的连络，又能够出头，控制行棋的方向。 飞：从原有棋子出发，向棋盘“日”字形的对角上下一子，叫小飞。若下在 “目”字形的对角上，就叫做大飞。飞还有一种形式，叫做象步飞。与象棋的象步走法相同。 压：在己方有子力配合的情况下，将棋下在对方棋子的上面，其主要作用是压制对方，扩张自己的外势、使己方的棋更加厚实，强大。压的着法往往还有声东击西的作用。 拆：从原有棋子的同一横线上，向左或向右有间隔地下一子。如果间隔一路，称为“拆一”，若是间隔二路，则称 “拆二”，其余类推。 挡：在双方棋子相互接触时，直接阻拦对方侵入己方地域或阻止对方被围的棋子向外冲出的着法。 扳：双方棋子相互靠紧时，一方从斜线上向对方兜头下一子，以阻止对方的棋子出路的着法。因扳的方向不同，有内扳、外扳、上扳、下扳之分。在一方扳时，对方还有反扳、连扳的着法。 托：在边角地带，紧挨着对方棋子的下边落子。托的着法具有占地、连络、攻击、腾挪、试应手等多种意义。 退：在双方棋子接触时，将被对方挡住前进去路的子向己方退回一步的着法。 虎：在原有呈“小尖”形二子的基础上，再向另一边尖一着，使三子呈现一“品”字形状的走法。 刺：在对方的断点、虎口附近或相当薄弱之处下一子，下一步能立即获得利益或分断对方。刺往往是先手，有迫使对方应一手棋的用意。 鼓：在己方间隔一路的两子中间再下一子，使棋形成为“品”字形。鼓后的形状与“虎”后棋形完全相同，区别在于棋的走法不同。 碰：在无己方棋子接应时，紧靠着对方的棋子旁边下一子，称为碰。通常是用于试探对方怎样应对，追求变化的一种手段。 靠：在有己方棋子作策应的情况下，紧贴对方棋子旁边下一子。 搭：在己方棋子与对方棋子间隔一路的情况下，紧贴对方棋子的两侧下一子的着法。也称作“搭靠”。 接：将可能被对方分断的棋子连接成一体的着法。 粘：zhān ，指将被对方“打吃”的棋子与己方的其它棋子连接成一个整体的着法。 挖：在对方相隔一路的棋子中间下一子的着法。这种着法通常用在能够分断对方棋子，并能有效地攻击对方的场合下。 夹：将对方棋子夹在我方两子中间的着法。 滚：也称滚打。指由己方先弃一、二子，然后把敌子打吃成凝聚形状的着法过程。 打：也称打吃。在对方棋子只有两口气时，再下一子，使其仅剩一口气的状态。 双打：下一子同时打吃对方两边的棋子，形成两者必得其一的着法。 提：下一子，使对方的棋子立即呈现无气被吃状态，随即把被吃的死棋从棋盘上提取掉。 征：也称做“征子”，是围棋中吃棋子的一种方法，俗称“拐羊头”。被“征吃”一方的棋子因只有一口气，如若没有己方棋子接应，即使立即逃出，对方可按预定的行棋次序继续紧气追杀，最终会将其全部吃掉。 顶：在原有一子的情况下，再用一子去顶撞对方棋子的一种着法。 跳：在原有棋子的同一条直线上，间隔一路下子的着法。这一着法是避免被动，使己方快速出头的有效之着。 双：为避免棋子被对方断开，将棋走成四子间隔一路并连起来的形状，俗称“板櫈”。常用于以守为攻的场合。 关：也称作“单关”。在原有棋子的同一条直线上，向中腹方向间隔一路下子的着法。 扑：故意在对方的虎口中送一子，迫使对方吃子而其自紧一气的着法。在双方对杀中常用来紧气和破眼。 挺：也称挺头。为防止己方的棋被对方扳住头而占据出头要点的着法。 贴：指紧随其后贴住对方棋子下子的着法，俗称“后推车”。 枷：将对方的棋子虚罩在己方的势力范围之内，使其无法继续长气和逃出的着法。 渡：在棋盘三路以下的边线上，能使己方两部分棋子取得连络的着法。 拐：双方棋子相互接触时，改变行棋方向，并挡住对方前进方向的走法。 爬：指一方的棋子在对方的压迫下，沿着棋盘二线或一线直线行棋的着法。 冲：指在己方原有棋子的基础上，向对方棋子间隔一路的空隙处冲击的着法。在中盘战斗中，“冲”与“断”经常配合使用。 跨：在己方有子策应的情况下，将子下在对方小飞的棋子旁，其目的是分断对方棋子的连络。 断：也称分断。直接割断对方棋子连络的着法。棋被断开后容易遭到攻击，棋诀之中有“棋从断处生”之说。 挤：向对方棋子集中的空隙处插入一子，使对方的棋形出现断点或缺陷的着法。 卡：qiǎ ，在对方棋形的要害处下一子，使其立即呈现某种缺陷的有效着法。 掖：紧挨着对方成“尖”形的两个子旁边下一子，具有约束对方棋形或使对方棋形出现断点或缺陷的着法。 曲：将棋背向对方的棋子走成弯曲的形状，称为“曲”。 团：将棋走成空三角或凝形的着法。通常在特定的场合下采用。 聚：在对方一块棋所围的空中连续下子，使对方最终无法做成两眼而被聚杀的着法。 补：将薄弱的或有缺陷的棋形加以强化的防御性着法。 逼：在对方棋子尚未安定时，向其逼近攻击，以限制其扩大地域或破坏其形成根据的可能性，逼迫对方选择就地做活或向外逃脱的着法。 镇：俗称“戴帽”。在对方棋子向中央单关的位置上下一子，多用于限制对方的势力，侵消其大模样或对企图出头的棋子进行攻击。 拦：阻止对方继续发展的着法。拦与挡的主要区别是不与对方的棋子直接接触。 打入：直接深入对方控制的势力范围，以达到破空或攻击对方目的的着法。 分投：指在对方势力范围的中央一带下子，并且左右均留有开拆的余地。一般情况下，分投的棋子多数选择下在三线。 吊：在对方势力范围上方行棋的着法。可起到限制、削减对方地域或阵势的作用。 浅消:从外部限制、削减对方的形势或地域。通常具有落子位置较高，不易被对方攻击等特点。 封：封锁对方棋子，防止其向外部发展的着法。 罩：在对方孤棋的外部，距离对方棋子较远处下子，形成一种大范围的势力圈，将对方的孤棋远远地笼罩起来，以威胁其安全的着法。 点：瞄着对方棋形的缺陷或要害位置下一子叫做“点”。 倒扑：也称倒包。在对方虎口内投一子打吃对方，如对方提吃，仍可再吃掉对方若干棋子的着法。 纽十字：对局双方将棋子走成互相绞断的“十字”形状。 肩冲：在对方棋子的斜上方成“尖”形的位置上下一子。除用于削减对方的势力外，还可以用于扩展己方的势力。 双飞燕：布局中常用的着法之一。当一方先占星位后，另一方分别在两边小飞挂，对其进行夹击。因棋形如同飞燕展翅，故而得名。 引征：在被征棋子行棋方向的前方下一子，企图接应被征吃的棋子。 并：在己方原有一子的同一线上并排下一子。一般在棋形有缺陷时，用来加强自己，保持棋的连络。 玉柱：在角部或边上原有一子的基础上再下立一子的着法。用于加强己方的形势或稳固己方地域。 尖顶：紧靠对方的棋子下一子，在使己方棋子成“尖”形的同时，起到顶撞对方棋子的作用。 鼻顶：在对方棋形正前方顶住对方若干棋子的着法。 连：下一子，将两处分开的棋子若即若离地取得联络，以保证大块棋子安全的着法。连的常用着法有跳、关、拆、小飞、大飞、大跳等。 棋形所谓棋形，就是多个棋子在棋盘上共同组合成的具体形状。由于棋子之间的结构、配置不同，棋盘上所呈现的棋形可分为好形、恶形、厚形、薄形、死形、活形及愚形等。 直三：一块被包围的棋，其眼位呈直线形状的三个交叉点，称为“直三”。 曲三：一块被包围的棋，其眼位呈弯曲线形状的三个交叉点，称为“曲三”，也称“拐三”或“弯三”。 直四：一块棋的眼位形状是直线形的四个交叉点，称其为“直四”。 曲四：一块棋的眼位形状是弯曲形的四个交叉点，称其为“曲四”。 方四：一块棋围成的四个交叉点呈方块形状，称其为“方四”。 丁四：该棋形因其围住的四个交叉点呈“丁”字形状而得名。 刀把五：由于棋子围住的五个交叉点形状很像一把菜刀，所以称这种棋形为“刀把五”，简称为“刀五”。 梅花五：指一块棋所围的五个交叉点像花朵样的形状。这种棋形称作“梅花五”简称“花五”。 花六：一块棋围有六个交叉点，其形状也呈花朵样，称其为“梅花六”，简称“花六”，也称“葡萄六”或“聚六”。 板六：一块棋围有六个交叉点，且呈板条形状的棋形称为“板六”。 聚七：指一块棋具有聚在一起的七个交叉点的棋形。 凝形：指众多棋子都凝聚在一起的棋形。 裂形：指己方的棋子被对方分裂开的形状。 愚形：指三个棋子围成的空三角形状。 斗笠形：指四个棋子形成的斗笠形状，也称“草帽形”。 猴子脸：由三个棋子构成的一种棋形，形状犹如猴子脸。 眼位：指能够使棋子做成眼形的具体位置。通常，一整块棋只要有足够的眼位，即至少有能做出两只眼的位置，就可以成为活棋。而眼位的要点就是一块棋中能够做出两只眼的关键位置。 俗称 高手：对棋艺水平很高者的称谓，通常指高段位棋手。 上手：对棋艺水平较高者的称谓，对局时常执白子，向对方授先或让子。 下手：对棋艺水平稍逊者的称谓，对局时常执黑子，由对方授先或让子。 本手：安分守己，掌握分寸的合理之着，也称为正着。 先手：下一着棋后，第二着能起到攻击、杀死对方或削减对方地域的作用，迫使对方不得不应，称为先手。 后手：在对方下子后，不得不应一着棋进行防御，以致被对方获得它投的权利，称为后手。己方下子后，如果对方不应也可称此着为后手。 随手：思考不成熟的草率之着。往往会丧失获取利益的机会，甚至还会造成不同程度的损失。 俗手：表面上看似正常，但实际上已在无形中吃了亏的错着，此种着法很容易被低水平的棋手屡次沿用，甚至成为习惯后仍不知其问题所在。 缓手：也称为“缓着”。是指一种坐失良机，下出当进而不进的松懈之着。此着在局部看似很正常，但就全局而言并不重要。一着棋，在局部看似正常，但就全局而言并不重要。 恶手：对己明显有害无益且有违棋理的错着，通常会带来局部的损失乃至全局的失败。其后果特别严重者，则称之为大恶手。 新手：在局部变化中经得起推敲的创新之着。 妙手：在对局中走出的出人意料的精妙着法，也称为妙着。 强手：指比常规着法更加积极主动或更具有对抗意识的着法。 鬼手：指冷僻而不易被人注意的凶狠、巧妙之着。 嵌手：在定式阶段故走劣着，看似笨拙，实含计谋，布下陷井，诱人上当的着法。 涩手：表面上看似拘谨忍让，实际上是含蓄扼要之着。 试应手：下一着棋，目的在于试探对方如何应对，然后再决定下一步在此局部如何行棋的着法试应手是对局中常用的着法，也称之为“试着”。 疑问手：不够妥善而值得推敲的一着棋。多指不明显的失误，与错着、恶手有着程度上的差别。 命令手：下一着棋，促使对方必须应，并且仅有一种方案可考虑，而无其它选择的余地。 胜负手：它有两种含义：一是指形势不容乐观的一方下出非此不足以扭转局面的关键之着，具有强烈的争胜负意识。二是指关键时刻在某一局部下出使对方非常难以应对的着法。","categories":[{"name":"Baduk","slug":"Baduk","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Baduk/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Sports

的围棋入门视频。主要内容：棋子的效率、棋子的间距。 效率围棋是围地的游戏，也是围地效率的比赛。谁围地的效率的叠加最高，谁赢棋的概率就围最大。 一盘棋开始以后，角上的应接一旦结束，行棋的着子点便自然而然的转到边上，这就涉及到“拆”的概念。 拆也叫“拆边”、“开拆”，经常用于在边上围地或寻求根据。一般情况下，“拆”的距离限度最小为拆一，最大为拆五，拆的大小限度是否合适，要以它所依靠的势力为条件，势力越大，拆的距离可越远。 下棋为什么要 拆一，拆二、拆三？其实都是实战的经验总结，拆一是与一个接一个对比而来的，是其效率的提升。 间距 夹攻：依仗强厚的外势从另一侧来攻击对方棋子，迫使其向己方的厚壁行棋或者出逃，有时候没有外势也可以进行夹攻，在攻击过程中处理好自身，因为攻击是最好的防守。 拆边：拆边，拆撑、拆开之意。特指三线子向同线对边部平行有间距地拆开，为布阵所用。四线子相应拆开，则称高拆。为近代围棋特征之一。 跳间隔：一线向中腹直着下一个子，叫“跳”，又叫“单关”。所谓单关，一般指对应于原有处在三、四线上的子向中腹或边部垂直地有间隔（隔一为单关，隔二为大关或二间关）跳出或跳下。在这种情况下，现今“关”已有被用“跳”取代的趋势。 镇在对方子的上方，间隔一线下一子叫“镇”。 飞攻用飞的办法从高位向低位压迫对方的子叫做“飞压”。 飞出、尖出当对方使用“镇”后，正面的出路被挡，只能用飞或尖的办法斜着出头。 搭用飞或跳的步法靠在对方子上叫“搭”，是一种借力使力的着法，在攻击和防守时常用。 打入：把子下到对方的地盘内，而且没有拆边的余地，这样的下法叫“打入”。","categories":[{"name":"Baduk","slug":"Baduk","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Baduk/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Sports

小目定式 特殊情况下白6可脱先，但白8一般不可。根据配合黑7也可于下图b位尖。如果黑棋a位有子，则有黑b打入的手段，白棋需要留意。 根据配合白6也可以粘，这样白8可以高拆。 如果黑棋特别重视上边，可以选择于黑3飞，虽然角部实空会稍有损失。黑7可以更强硬地在a位长。黑3也可于b位跳，此时黑棋不需在黑7虎而应当在a位长。但是，一般来说，如果黑3走在b位，往往意味着黑5要在6位扳。如果接下来黑棋打吃后虎起，这是骗着，小心应对。 黑棋在a位或3位夹可以引发战斗，最简明的变化是白棋逃出，然后伺机夹击黑3一子。今后白棋可以以白b、黑c、白d、黑e的顺序搜刮角部。黑5也可能拆二。 以现代棋的节奏而言，白棋小飞挂角时黑棋一定会夹。如果黑棋夹得比较远，如图中黑3、a、b、c，白棋可以选择4位，黑棋大概5位爬。如果黑棋想战斗也可以冲断，此后变化会非常复杂。如果黑棋不想给白棋如下图的利用，黑7也可以多爬一路（虽然更缓）。 白14于黑13左边断。 但是，对于一间低夹，如果白4飞压，黑棋再爬就太委屈了，几乎一定会于本图冲断。结果白棋安定，大致两分。但考虑到黑3夹击的用意，此图黑棋大概不满。所以一间低夹往往起不到攻击的效果。黑11也可于a位跳出战斗，接下来白棋于b位跳是进攻的手筋。 一间高夹是小飞挂中最严厉的，此时白棋不可飞压，否则被冲断后无法收拾。大致如下图白4跳，黑5飞。此后容易形成战斗。一个妥协的方案如下图所示。 此后白b官子极大。白12也可以于13位挖，此后黑a，白12，黑b，黑棋不如本图厚，但实地比本图多。","categories":[{"name":"Baduk","slug":"Baduk","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Baduk/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Sports

Spark PlugIt is a device that delivers electric current to the combustion chamber which ignites the air-fuel mixture leading to the abrupt expansion of gas. Four Stroke Engine CycleThe four strokes of the engine go by the following names: Suction&#x2F;Intake StrokeIntake stroke occurs when the air-fuel mixture is introduced to the combustion chamber. In this stroke, the piston moves from TDC (Top Dead Center – the farthest position of piston to the crankshaft) to BDC (Bottom Dead Center – the nearest position of piston to the crankshaft.) The movement of the piston towards the BDC creates a low-pressure area in the cylinder. The inlet valve remains to open a few degrees of crankshaft rotation after BDC. The intake valve then closes and the air-fuel mixture is sealed in the cylinder Inlet Valve – Open Outlet Valve ­­ – Closed Crankshaft Rotation – 180° Compression StrokeIn compression stroke, the trapped air-fuel mixture is compressed inside the cylinder. During the stroke, the piston moves from BDC to TDC compressing the air-fuel mixture. The momentum of the flywheel helps the piston move forward. Compressing the air-fuel mixture allows more energy to be released when the charge is ignited. The charge is the volume of compressed air-fuel mixture trapped inside the combustion chamber ready for ignition. The inlet and outlet valves must be closed to ensure that the cylinder is sealed resulting in compression. Inlet Valve – Closed Outlet Valve ­­ – Closed Crankshaft Rotation – 180° (Total 360°) Power&#x2F;Combustion StrokeThe second rotation of the crankshaft has begun when it completes a full rotation during the compression stroke. The power stroke occurs when the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited with the help of a spark plug. Ignition or Combustion is the rapid, oxidizing chemical reaction in which a fuel chemically combines with oxygen in the atmosphere and releases energy in the form of heat. The hot expanding gases force the piston head away from the cylinder head. Inlet Valve – Closed Outlet Valve ­­ – Closed Crankshaft Rotation – 180° (Total 540°) Exhaust StrokeAs the piston reaches BDC during the power stroke, combustion is complete and the cylinder is filled with exhaust gases. The exhaust valves open during this stroke and the inertia of the flywheel and other moving parts push the piston back to TDC, forcing the exhaust gases through the open exhaust valve. At the end of the exhaust stroke, the piston is at TDC and one operating cycle has been completed. Inlet Valve – Closed Outlet Valve ­­ – Open Crankshaft Rotation – 180° (Total 720°) Comparison Between 2-stroke engine and a 4-stroke engine A 4-stroke engine weighs 50% heavier than a 2-stroke engine. A 4-stroke engine is more efficient than a 2-stroke engine because fuel is consumed once every 4 strokes. A 2-stroke engine creates more torque at a higher RPM, while a 4-stroke engine creates a higher torque at a lower RPM. A 4-stroke engine is quieter than a 2-stroke engine. 2-stroke engines tend to wear out fast because they are designed to run at a higher RPM. 2-stroke engines are easier to fix because of simple construction. 4-stroke engines have complex designs with more parts making them more expensive and repairs cost more. Two-stroke engines are typically found in smaller applications such as chainsaws, boat motors, and dirt bikes. Four-stroke engines are found in go-karts, lawnmowers, and combustion engines in your car.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Swiss Tools 瑞士工具","slug":"2020-12-15-00-28-swiss-tools","date":"2020-12-14T16:28:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.325Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/15/2020-12-15-00-28-swiss-tools/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/15/2020-12-15-00-28-swiss-tools/","excerpt":"","text":"PB Swiss Tools has been developing and producing uncompromising Swiss quality since 1878: precise, innovative and reliable.

A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: condensing coil expansion valve evaporator coil compressor There are eight main components that play a pivotal role in cooling your home: A Thermostat, Condenser, Compressor, Fan, Metering Device, Evaporator, Blower and a Filter. The first step begins with setting your thermostat to the desired temperature. This triggers the condenser fan and compressor to turn on. The compressor begins pumping a fluid called a ‘refrigerant’ throughout the system. This is used because of its low boiling point.Refrigerant constantly changes from a vapor to a liquid in order to move heat from inside your home to the outdoors. It enters the compressor as a low-temperature, low-pressure vapor. After it’s compressed, it leaves as a high-temperature, high-pressure vapor.It then travels through the condenser coil, where the vapor condenses into a liquid. The heat it has collected indoors and after compression, is released outside. The fan inside the unit helps with this process. The refrigerant leaves the condenser as a medium-temperature, high-pressure liquid.Then, flows to the metering device. In this case, a thermal expansion valve is used. A pin inside the valve adjusts the flow rate of refrigerant depending on the temperature at the evaporator end, using a ‘sensing bulb’.As it flows through the valve, its pressure drops significantly, releasing a low-temperature, low-pressure liquid&#x2F;vapor mix. The lower pressure allows room temperature air to boil the refrigerant. The chilled refrigerant then flows through the evaporator coil. The blower begins circulating air throughout the house. Room-temperature air is pulled in through the return duct and passes through the filter to remove particulates. The heat from the air is absorbed into the refrigerant inside the evaporator coil, dispersing chilled air through the supply duct.As the air passes over the coil, the refrigerant is boiled and evaporates back into vapor form. During this process, condensation forms on the outside of the coil and exits through a condensate drain line.The refrigerant returns to the condenser to disperse the collected heat outdoors, and the cycle starts again. Your home is slowly cooled, and the thermostat shuts off the equipment once it senses the desired temperature.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Engine Start Motor 发动机启动马达","slug":"2020-12-13-15-13-engine-start-motor","date":"2020-12-13T07:13:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.323Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/13/2020-12-13-15-13-engine-start-motor/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/13/2020-12-13-15-13-engine-start-motor/","excerpt":"The starter motor is an electric motor that turns over or “cranks” the engine to start.

The starter motor has a pinion, which meshes with the teeth on the flywheel of the engine and turns the crankshaft. The model shown here is a pre-engaged type starter motor used in modern vehicles. It uses an electric motor to provide torque to the crankshaft. The power for this motor can be drawn from the battery. A simplified circuit of power supply is shown here. The power from the battery is supplied to a solenoid. An ignition switch is installed between the battery and the solenoid to turn the power on and off. The solenoid is an electromagnet which requires small current to get energized. As the ignition switch is turned on, the solenoid gets energized. A moving core known as a plunger slides along the coil, which connects two copper terminals of a contactor switch. This completes the circuit from the battery to the motor and causes the rotor to spin. When the solenoid is de-energized the core returns back and disconnects the motor from the battery. We may wonder why the solenoid and the contactor are used instead of directly connecting the battery to the motor and reducing the complexity. The reason behind not using this circuit is the high current demand of the motor. The motor is considerably powerful and demands heavy current for operation. To handle this current, the ignition switch needs to be unusually large. It also requires very thick wires running from the battery to the switch, and then to the motor which is technically inconvenient. This is why solenoid is used which demands lower current for being energized. The solenoid has another crucial function, it helps to slide the pinion and engage it with a flywheel before the motor starts to spin. As the pinion slides towards the flywheel, it slightly rotates on its axis as shown here. This rotation is achieved by using a helical spline. This rotation helps meshing the pinion with the flywheel more conveniently as the pinion and flywheel is properly meshed the contactor switch gets closed and the motor spins. As we can observe that the pinion is considerably small compared to the flywheel. The gear ratio of the flywheel and pinion is generally from fifteen to one to twenty to one the high torque obtained from this gear reduction is still insufficient to crank the engine. So a planetary gear set is introduced to increase the torque further. Planetary gears are incredibly useful for large gear reductions with less weight and limited space. It consists of a sun gear, a ring gear, a carrier, and a set of planet gears. In starters the ring gear is fixed the sun gear is the input and the planet carrier is the output. For the setup shown here the gear ratio is seven to one. The combined gear reduction results in enough torque to spin the engine. As the engine is started, the pinion needs to be disengaged from the flywheel to prevent back drive of the motor, which might damage it due to the excessive speed. This is done by releasing the ignition switch, which de-energizes the solenoid and the pinion returns back. But if the operator fails to release the ignition switch, as soon as the engine is started. The flywheel will drive the pinion too fast and damage the motor to prevent this, a one-way clutch is used. The one-way clutch has a set of rollers installed between the outer and inner races. When the outer race is rotated by the motor the rollers get trapped and transfer power to the pinion. As soon as the engine is started and drives the pinion at a high speed, the rollers get released and power transfer is stopped.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Stereographic Projection 球面投影","slug":"2020-12-12-20-08-stereographic-projection","date":"2020-12-12T12:08:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.317Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-20-08-stereographic-projection/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-20-08-stereographic-projection/","excerpt":"In geometry, the stereographic projection is a particular mapping (function) that projects a sphere onto a plane.

In such a projection, great circles are mapped to circles, and loxodromes become logarithmic spirals. Stereographic projections have a very simple algebraic form that results immediately from similarity of triangles. In the above figures, let the stereographic sphere have radius r, and the z-axis positioned as shown. Then a variety of different transformation formulas are possible depending on the relative positions of the projection plane and z-axis. The transformation equations for a sphere of radius R are given by $$\\begin{aligned}&amp;x&#x3D;k \\cos \\phi \\sin \\left(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0}\\right) \\&amp;y&#x3D;k\\left[\\cos \\phi_{1} \\sin \\phi-\\sin \\phi_{1} \\cos \\phi \\cos \\left(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\lambda_{0}$ is the central longitude, $\\phi_{1}$ is the central latitude, and $$k&#x3D;\\frac{2 R}{1+\\sin \\phi_{1} \\sin \\phi+\\cos \\phi_{1} \\cos \\phi \\cos \\left(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0}\\right)}$$ The inverse formulas for latitude $\\phi$ and longitude $\\lambda$ are then given by $$\\begin{aligned}&amp;\\phi&#x3D;\\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\cos c \\sin \\phi_{1}+\\frac{y \\sin c \\cos \\phi_{1}}{\\rho}\\right) \\&amp;\\lambda&#x3D;\\lambda_{0}+\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x \\sin c}{\\rho \\cos \\phi_{1} \\cos c-y \\sin \\phi_{1} \\sin c}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ where $$\\begin{aligned}&amp;\\rho&#x3D;\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} \\&amp;c&#x3D;2 \\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{2 R}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ and the two-argument form of the inverse tangent function is best used for this computation.

Use of the β and π Methods to Determine Fold OrientationThe orientation of bedding measured at different locations across a fold can be used to determine the attitude of the fold axis and of the axial plane. The readings have introduced these methods. In this article, we will use the following strike and dip measurements of folded beds to illustrate the methods: 110°&#x2F;40°SW 150°&#x2F;45°SW 080°&#x2F;40°SE 040°&#x2F;50°SE 005°&#x2F;70°SE 050°&#x2F;45°SE 132°&#x2F;60°SW The β-diagramOn a new overlay, plot the fold limb orientations as planes. Mark each intersection between planes with a point. If more than two planes intersect at a single location, draw a circle around the point for each additional plane. Mark the centre of density of the point distribution. In Figure above (labs), the centre of density is marked with a star. Use the circles to help you to account for the extra “weight” of intersections of more than two planes. One way to think about the weight of points is to imagine each intersection as a small magnet. Where more than two planes intersect, there is an additional magnet for each additional plane. Now imagine that you have a small iron sphere suspended on a string. If you were to hold the sphere just above the centre of the cluster of magnets, each magnet would exert a force on the sphere; magnets located closer together would have a stronger pull on the sphere than a single magnet by itself. Therefore, the suspend sphere might be pulled more to one side than another. The centre of density of the point distribution is the point above which the sphere would come to rest. The centre of density on a β-diagram is referred to as a β-axis. It is an estimate of the orientation of the fold axis. In our example, the β-axis has an orientation of 40°&#x2F;172°. The π-diagramOn a new overlay, plot the poles to the fold limb orientations. Rotate the overlay until you find the great circle that best fits the set of poles. If the fold measurements are correct, your plotting is correct, and the fold is perfectly cylindrical, then all of the poles should fall on a single great circle. In this example, however, this is not the case, so a great circle has been chosen using the following criteria: Many of the poles fall on the great circle, or very close to the great circle. For poles that do not fall on the great circle, an attempt is made to distribute them as evenly as possible on either side of the great circle. The great circle you choose to fit the poles is called the π-circle. Find the pole to the π-circle. This is called the π-axis. The π-axis for this example is oriented 40°&#x2F;175°. The π-axis, like the β-axis, is an estimate of the fold axis. Under ideal circumstances, the β-axis you calculate should be the same as the π-axis. This unusual, however, because it is much more difficult to judge the centre of density of a point cluster than it is to fit a curve to a set of points. The π-diagram can also be used to estimate the orientation of the axial plane. To do this, we use the angle between the fold limbs, called the interlimb angle. The interlimb angle can be estimated from the spread of the poles along the π-circle. In Figure below, the interlimb angle measured through the poles is 105°. (You can measure this by rotating your stereonet until the π-circle lies on a great circle, and then counting off the distance.) Note, however, that there are actually two possible interlimb angles: The other is 75°. To decide which interlimb angle to use requires that you have some additional knowledge about the shape of the fold. If the fold is tightly closed and has an interlimb angle of less than 90°, then you would use 75°. If the fold is less tightly closed, and has an interlimb angle greater than 90°, then you would use 105°. Regardless of which interlimb angle you use, the procedure is the same. First, mark the midpoint (x) of the interlimb angle. Next, rotate your overlay until the midpoint and the π-axis lie on the same great circle, and trace the great circle to find the limb bisectrix, the plane that lies exactly between the limbs of the fold (as represented by your data). The limb bisectrix is an approximation of the axial plane. If we had independent information that the fold was not tightly closed, then we would choose the great circle connecting the midpoint of the 105° angle ($M_{1}$) and the π-axis. The orientation of the axial plane ($A_{1}$) would be 164°&#x2F;76°W. This fold could be described as moderately plunging and steeply inclined. If we knew that the fold was tightly closed, then we would choose the great circle connecting $M_{2}$ and the π-axis. The orientation of the axial plane ($A_{2}$) would be 066°&#x2F;42°S. This fold could be described as moderately plunging and steeply inclined. 通过球心的面在赤平面上的投影称为大圆，未通过球心的面在赤平面上的投影称为小圆。 由于构造特点各不相同，为了清楚反映构造起见，采用两种不同的投影方法： 一是面的极点图解，即π图解，就是用面的法线作为点来投影，例如圆柱状褶皱的褶皱面的极点成一个大圆环带通过极点画出最合适的大圆，称为π圆，π圆的极点就是π轴。 另一种是面的大圆图解，即β图解，把所测量的每个面作为大圆来投影；如果将圆柱状褶皱的褶皱面投影，所有大圆轨迹相交于一点，称为β轴，代表褶皱轴的产状。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Dào Dé Jīng 道德经","slug":"2020-12-12-18-42-dao-de-jing","date":"2020-12-12T10:42:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.282Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-18-42-dao-de-jing/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-18-42-dao-de-jing/","excerpt":"The Dào that can be told of is not an Unvarying Way; The names that can be named are not unvarying names.

If we stop looking for ‘persons of superior morality’ (Xián&#x2F;贤) to put in power, there will be no more jealousies among the people. If we cease to set store by products that are hard to get, there will be no more thieves. If the people never see such things as excite desire, their hearts will remain placid and undisturbed. Therefore the Sage rules By emptying their hearts And filling their bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening their sinews Ever striving to make the people knowledgeless and desireless. Indeed he sees to it that if there be any who have knowledge, they dare not interfere. Yet through his actionless activity all things are duly regulated. The Dào is like an empty vessel That yet may be drawn from Without ever needing to be filled. It is bottomless; the very progenitor of all things in the world. In it all sharpness is blunted, All tangles untied, All glare tempered, All dust smoothed. It is like a deep pool that never dries. Was it too the child of something else? We cannot tell. But as a substanceless image it existed before the Ancestor. Heaven and Earth are ruthless; To them the Ten Thousand Things are but as straw dogs. The Sage too is ruthless; To him the people are but as straw dogs. Yet Heaven and Earth and all that lies between Is like a bellows In that it is empty, but gives a supply that never fails. Work it, and more comes out. Whereas the force of words is soon spent. Far better is it to keep what is in the heart. The Valley Spirit never dies. It is named the Mysterious Female. And the Doorway of the Mysterious Female Is the base from which Heaven and Earth sprang. It is there within us all the while; Draw upon it as you will, it never runs dry. Heaven is eternal, the Earth Everlasting. How come they to be so? Is it because they do not foster their own lives; That is why they live so long. Therefore the Sage Puts himself in the background; but is always to the fore. Remains outside; but is always there. Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end That all his personal ends are fulfilled? The highest good is like that of water. The goodness of water is that it benefits the ten thousand creatures; yet itself does not scramble, but is content with the places that all men disdain. It is this that makes water so near to the Dào. And if men think the ground the best place for building a house upon, If among thoughts they value those that are profound, If in friendship they value gentleness, In words, truth; in government, good order; In deeds, effectiveness; in actions, timeliness – In each case it is because they prefer what does not lead to strife, And therefore does not go amiss. Stretch a bow to the very full, And you will wish you had stopped in time; Temper a sword-edge to its very sharpest, And you will find it soon grows dull When bronze and jade fill your hall It can no longer be guarded. Wealth and place breed insolence That brings ruin in its train. When your work is done, then withdraw! Such is Heaven’s Way. When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? Dào produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it；it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called ‘The mysterious Quality’ (of the Dào). There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it; – for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard，and the weak the strong，but no one is able to carry it out in practice.Therefore a sage has said, ‘He who accepts his state’s reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars‘lord; To him who bears men‘s direful woes They all the name of King accord.’ Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Dé) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. 《道德经 &#x2F; Dào Dé Jīng》, 春秋时期老子 (李耳) 的哲学作品,又称《道德真经》、《老子》、《五千言》、《老子五千文》,是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作。 道德经分上下两篇, 原文上篇《德经》、下篇《道经》, 不分章。 《道德经》文本以哲学意义之“道德”为纲宗,论述修身、治国、用兵、养生之道, 而多以政治为旨归, 乃所谓“内圣外王”之学。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Chinese 国学","slug":"Chinese-国学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Chinese-%E5%9B%BD%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Logic Gate 门电路","slug":"2020-12-12-15-25-logic-gate","date":"2020-12-12T07:25:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.281Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-15-25-logic-gate/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-15-25-logic-gate/","excerpt":"","text":"A logic gate is an idealized model of computation or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.

From a strategy perspective, microservices architecture essentially follows the Unix philosophy of “Do one thing and do it well”. Martin Fowler describes a microservices-based architecture as having the following properties: Lends itself to a continuous delivery software development process. A change to a small part of the application only requires rebuilding and redeploying only one or a small number of services. Adheres to principles such as fine-grained interfaces (to independently deployable services), business-driven development (e.g. domain-driven design). It is common for microservices architectures to be adopted for cloud-native applications,serverless computing, and applications using lightweight container deployment.According to Fowler, because of the large number (when compared to monolithic application implementations) of services,decentralized continuous delivery and DevOps with holistic service monitoring are necessary to effectively develop, maintain, and operate such applications. A consequence of (and rationale for) following this approach is that the individual microservices can be individually scaled.In the monolithic approach, an application supporting three functions would have to be scaled in its entirety even if only one of these functions had a resource constraint.With microservices, only the microservice supporting the function with resource constraints needs to be scaled out, thus providing resource and cost optimization benefits.","categories":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Computer/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Software","slug":"Software","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Software/"}]},{"title":"CPU 中央处理器","slug":"2020-12-12-13-29-cpu","date":"2020-12-12T05:29:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.273Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-13-29-cpu/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-13-29-cpu/","excerpt":"","text":"A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor,main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program.

The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged.Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components. An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. A GPU has more arithmetic logic units than a typical CPU.It increased ability to process simple operations in parallel.","categories":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Computer/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Hardware","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Hardware/"}]},{"title":"Gas Station 加油站","slug":"2020-12-11-22-35-gas-station","date":"2020-12-11T14:35:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.271Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/11/2020-12-11-22-35-gas-station/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/11/2020-12-11-22-35-gas-station/","excerpt":"","text":"A gas station, also known as a filling station, fueling station, service station or petrol station is a facility which sells fuel and lubricants for motor vehicles.

In number theory, Fermat’s Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat’s conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers x, y, and z satisfy the equation $x^{n} + y^{n} &#x3D; z^{n}$ for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n &#x3D; 1 and n &#x3D; 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions. The proposition was first stated as a theorem by Pierre de Fermat around 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica; Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. Although other statements claimed by Fermat without proof were subsequently proven by others and credited as theorems of Fermat (for instance, Fermat’s theorem on sums of two squares), Fermat’s Last Theorem resisted proof, leading to doubt that Fermat ever had a correct proof and it becoming known as a conjecture rather than a theorem. After 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995; it was described as a “stunning advance” in the citation for Wiles’s Abel Prize award in 2016. It also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Formulas 数学公式 1901-1927","slug":"2020-12-10-10-41-formulas-1901-1927","date":"2020-12-10T02:41:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T14:51:41.870Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-41-formulas-1901-1927/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-41-formulas-1901-1927/","excerpt":"1901$$\\begin{array}{c}P\\left(\\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\\cdots+X_{n}-n_{\\mu}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{n}} \\leq x\\right) \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} e^{-t^{2} &#x2F; 2} d t\\end{array}$$ Lyapunov’s theorem in probability theory is a theorem that establishes very general sufficient conditions for the convergence of the distributions of sums of independent random variables to the normal distribution.

It connects the curvature of a surface (from geometry) to its Euler characteristic (from topology). In the simplest application, the case of a triangle on a plane, the sum of its angles is 180 degrees. The Gauss–Bonnet formula extends this to more complicated shapes and curved surfaces, connecting the local and global geometries. The theorem is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who developed a version but never published it, and Pierre Ossian Bonnet, who published a special case in 1848. 1864$$\\begin{array}{cc}\\nabla \\cdot E&#x3D;0 &amp; \\nabla \\cdot B&#x3D;0 \\\\nabla \\times E&#x3D;-\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t} &amp; \\nabla \\times B&#x3D;\\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\end{array}$$ Maxwell’s equations are a set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits.

The system can exchange energy with the heat bath, so that the states of the system will differ in total energy. The principal thermodynamic variable of the canonical ensemble, determining the probability distribution of states, is the absolute temperature (symbol: T). The ensemble typically also depends on mechanical variables such as the number of particles in the system (symbol: N) and the system’s volume (symbol: V), each of which influence the nature of the system’s internal states. An ensemble with these three parameters is sometimes called the NVT ensemble. 1896$$\\pi(n) \\sim \\frac{n}{\\log n}$$ In number theory, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs. The theorem was proved independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin in 1896 using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann (in particular, the Riemann zeta function). The first such distribution found is π(N) ~ N &#x2F; log(N), where π(N) is the prime-counting function (the number of primes less than or equal to N) and log(N) is the natural logarithm of N. This means that for large enough N, the probability that a random integer not greater than N is prime is very close to 1 &#x2F; log(N). Consequently, a random integer with at most 2n digits (for large enough n) is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (log(101000) ≈ 2302.6), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (log(102000) ≈ 4605.2). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first N integers is roughly log(N).","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Formulas 数学公式 1500-1799","slug":"2020-12-10-10-28-formulas-1500-1799","date":"2020-12-10T02:28:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T18:25:03.902Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-28-formulas-1500-1799/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-28-formulas-1500-1799/","excerpt":"1500$$\\begin{aligned}&amp;x^{3} + mx &#x3D; n\\&amp;\\Rightarrow\\&amp;x&#x3D;\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{n^{2}}{4}+\\frac{m^{3}}{27}}+\\frac{n}{2}}-\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{n^{2}}{4}+\\frac{m^{3}}{27}}-\\frac{n}{2}}\\end{aligned}$$ At some point in the early 1500’s, an Italian mathematician named Scipione del Ferro determined a general solution for what is known as the depressed cubic equation.

The cases n &#x3D; 1 and n &#x3D; 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions. 1674$$\\frac{\\pi}{4}&#x3D;1-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{7}+\\cdots$$ In mathematics, the Leibniz formula for ${\\pi}$, named after Gottfried Leibniz. It is also called the Madhava–Leibniz series as it is a special case of a more general series expansion for the inverse tangent function, first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in the 14th century, the specific case first published by Leibniz around 1674. The series for the inverse tangent function, which is also known as Gregory’s series, can be given by: $$\\arctan x&#x3D;x-\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+\\frac{x^{5}}{5}-\\frac{x^{7}}{7}+\\cdots$$ The Leibniz formula for $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ can be obtained by putting x &#x3D; 1 into this series. It also is the Dirichlet L-series of the non-principal Dirichlet character of modulus 4 evaluated at s &#x3D; 1, and therefore the value β(1) of the Dirichlet beta function. 1735$$\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6}&#x3D;1+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{16}+\\cdots$$ The Basel problem is a problem in mathematical analysis with relevance to number theory, first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1650 and solved by Leonhard Euler in 1734, and read on 5 December 1735 in The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Since the problem had withstood the attacks of the leading mathematicians of the day, Euler’s solution brought him immediate fame when he was twenty-eight. Euler generalised the problem considerably, and his ideas were taken up years later by Bernhard Riemann in his seminal 1859 paper “On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude”, in which he defined his zeta function and proved its basic properties. The problem is named after Basel, hometown of Euler as well as of the Bernoulli family who unsuccessfully attacked the problem. The Basel problem asks for the precise summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers, i.e. the precise sum of the infinite series: $$\\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{2}}&#x3D;\\frac{1}{1^{2}}+\\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\\frac{1}{3^{2}}+\\cdots$$ The sum of the series is approximately equal to 1.644934. The Basel problem asks for the exact sum of this series (in closed form), as well as a proof that this sum is correct. Euler found the exact sum to be $\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6}$ and announced this discovery in 1735. His arguments were based on manipulations that were not justified at the time, although he was later proven correct. He produced a truly rigorous proof in 1741. 1737$$\\sum_{p_{n}} \\frac{1}{p_{n}}$$ Euler achieved the first major advance beyond Euclid’s proof by combining his method of generating functions with another highlight of ancient Greek number theory, unique factorization into primes. Theorem [Euler product for the zeta function]. The identity $$\\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{s}}&#x3D;\\prod_{p \\text { prime }} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$ holds for all s such that the left-hand side converges absolutely. Proof : Here and henceforth we adopt the convention:The notation $\\prod_{p}$ or $\\sum_{p}$ means a product or sum over prime p. 1746$$\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial t^{2}}&#x3D;c^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}$$ The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of waves—as they occur in classical physics—such as mechanical waves (e.g. water waves, sound waves and seismic waves) or light waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. Historically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d’Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. In 1746, d’Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation. 1750$$V-E+F&#x3D;2$$ Euler formula: for any convex polyhedron, the number of vertices and faces together is exactly two more than the number of edges. Symbolically V−E+F&#x3D;2. For instance, a tetrahedron has four vertices, four faces, and six edges; 4-6+4&#x3D;2. A version of the formula dates over 100 years earlier than Euler, to Descartes in 1630. Descartes gives a discrete form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, stating that the sum of the face angles of a polyhedron is 2π(V−2), from which he infers that the number of plane angles is 2F+2V-4. The number of plane angles is always twice the number of edges, so this is equivalent to Euler’s formula, but later authors such as Lakatos, Malkevitch, and Polya disagree, feeling that the distinction between face angles and edges is too large for this to be viewed as the same formula. The formula V−E+F&#x3D;2 was (re)discovered by Euler; he wrote about it twice in 1750, and in 1752 published the result, with a faulty proof by induction for triangulated polyhedra based on removing a vertex and retriangulating the hole formed by its removal. The retriangulation step does not necessarily preserve the convexity or planarity of the resulting shape, so the induction does not go through. Another early attempt at a proof, by Meister in 1784, is essentially the triangle removal proof given here, but without justifying the existence of a triangle to remove. In 1794, Legendre provided a complete proof, using spherical angles. Cauchy got into the act in 1811, citing Legendre and adding incomplete proofs based on triangle removal, ear decomposition, and tetrahedron removal from a tetrahedralization of a partition of the polyhedron into smaller polyhedra. Hilton and Pederson provide more references as well as entertaining speculation on Euler’s discovery of the formula. 1760For a non-conservative force which depends on velocity, it may be possible to find a potential energy function V that depends on positions and velocities. If the generalized forces $Q_{i}$ can be derived from a potential V such that $$Q_{i}&#x3D;\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\dot{q}{i}}-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q{i}}$$ equating to Lagrange’s equations and defining the Lagrangian as L &#x3D; T − V obtains Lagrange’s equations of the second kind or the Euler–Lagrange equations of motion $$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_{i}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_{i}}&#x3D;0$$ However, the Euler–Lagrange equations can only account for non-conservative forces if a potential can be found as shown. This may not always be possible for non-conservative forces, and Lagrange’s equations do not involve any potential, only generalized forces; therefore they are more general than the Euler–Lagrange equations. The Euler–Lagrange equations also follow from the calculus of variations. The variation of the Lagrangian is $$\\delta L&#x3D;\\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_{i}} \\delta q_{i}+\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}{i}} \\delta \\dot{q}{i}\\right) , \\quad \\delta \\dot{q}{i} \\equiv \\delta \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q{i}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left(\\delta q_{i}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\ ,$$ which has a form similar to the total differential of L, but the virtual displacements and their time derivatives replace differentials, and there is no time increment in accordance with the definition of the virtual displacements. An integration by parts with respect to time can transfer the time derivative of $\\delta q_{i}$ to the $\\partial L &#x2F; \\partial(\\mathrm{d} q_{i} &#x2F; \\mathrm{d} t)$, in the process exchanging $\\mathrm{d}\\left(\\delta q_{i}\\right) &#x2F; \\mathrm{d} t$ for $\\delta q_{i}$, allowing the independent virtual displacements to be factorized from the derivatives of the Lagrangian, $$\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \\delta L \\mathrm{d} t&#x3D;\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_{i}} \\delta q_{i}+\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}{i}} \\delta q{i}\\right)-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}{i}} \\delta q{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} t&#x3D;\\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\\left[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}{i}} \\delta q{i}\\right]{t{1}}^{t_{2}}+\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_{i}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}{i}}\\right) \\delta q{i} \\mathrm{d} t \\ .$$ Now, if the condition $\\delta q_{i}(t_{1}) &#x3D; \\delta q_{i}(t_{2}) &#x3D; 0$ holds for all i, the terms not integrated are zero. If in addition the entire time integral of $\\delta L$ is zero, then because the $\\delta q_{i}$ are independent, and the only way for a definite integral to be zero is if the integrand equals zero, each of the coefficients of $\\delta q_{i}$ must also be zero. Then we obtain the equations of motion. This can be summarized by Hamilton’s principle; $$\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \\delta L \\mathrm{~d} t&#x3D;0 \\ .$$ The time integral of the Lagrangian is another quantity called the action, defined as $$S&#x3D;\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} L \\mathrm{~d} t \\ ,$$ which is a functional; it takes in the Lagrangian function for all times between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ and returns a scalar value. Its dimensions are the same as [angular momentum], [energy]·[time], or [length]·[momentum]. With this definition Hamilton’s principle is $$\\delta S&#x3D;0 \\ .$$ Thus, instead of thinking about particles accelerating in response to applied forces, one might think of them picking out the path with a stationary action, with the end points of the path in configuration space held fixed at the initial and final times. Hamilton’s principle is sometimes referred to as the principle of least action, however the action functional need only be stationary, not necessarily a maximum or a minimum value. Any variation of the functional gives an increase in the functional integral of the action. 1799$$\\begin{array}{c}\\forall p(x) \\in \\mathbb{C}[x] \\\\exists z \\in \\mathbb{C}: p(z)&#x3D;0\\end{array}$$ The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with its imaginary part equal to zero. 高斯一生总共对这个定理给出了四个证明，其中第一个是在他22岁时（1799年）的博士论文中给出的。高斯给出的证明既有几何的，也有函数的，还有积分的方法。高斯关于这一命题的证明方法是去证明其根的存在性，开创了关于研究存在性命题的新途径。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Frozen 2 冰雪奇缘 2","slug":"2020-12-09-20-14-disney-frozen-2","date":"2020-12-09T12:14:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T14:51:41.858Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/09/2020-12-09-20-14-disney-frozen-2/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/09/2020-12-09-20-14-disney-frozen-2/","excerpt":"","text":"In this sequel to ‘Frozen,’ Queen Elsa has lifted the spell that left her kingdom in an eternal winter.

While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. 稻，又称稻谷、稻米，俗称大米，常简称为米，是人类重要的粮食作物之一。 耕种及食用的历史相当悠久，分为水稻和光稃稻。 稻的栽培起源于约西元前8200年南中国珠江中游的聚落地带，另有考古发现在约西元前8200年前的中国湖南也有种早期稻米。 在1993年，考古队在道县玉蟾岩发现了世界最早的古栽培稻，距今约8200年。 水稻在中国与东南亚广为栽种后，逐渐向西传播到印度，在亚洲季风气候区是自古以来的主食，中世纪时引入欧洲南部。 现时全世界有一半的人口食用稻，主要在亚洲、欧洲南部和热带美洲及非洲部分地区。 2013年稻的总产量占世界粮食作物产量第二位，仅低于玉米。 籼稻（Oryza sativa indica）：有20%左右为直链淀粉。属中黏性。籼稻起源于亚热带，种植于热带和亚热带地区，生长期短，在无霜期长的地方一年可多次成熟。去壳成为籼米后，外观细长、透明度低。有的品种表皮发红，如中国江西出产的红米，煮熟后米饭较干、松。通常用于萝卜糕、米粉、炒饭。广东人爱吃的丝苗米是籼稻的一种。为南亚、东南亚、中国南部地区主要食用米。 粳稻（Oryza sativa japonica）：粳稻的直链淀粉较少，低于15%。种植于温带和寒带地区，生长期长，一般一年只能成熟一次，台湾一般被认为是北半球粳稻生长最南区。去壳成为粳米后，外观圆短、透明（部分品种米粒有局部白粉质）。煮食特性介于糯米与籼米之间。为中国北部及台湾、日本、朝鲜半岛主要食用米。 糯稻（Oryza sativa var glutinosa）：支链淀粉含量接近100%，黏性最高。又分粳糯(圆糯)及籼糯(长糯)，粳糯外观圆短，籼糯外观细长，颜色均为白色不透明。煮熟后米饭较软、黏。粳糯常见用途为用于酿酒、米糕、红龟粿、甜粿、汤圆等。籼糯则作为八宝粥、粽子、油饭等原料。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"英语 English","slug":"英语-English","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD-English/"}]},{"title":"Korean 韩语入门 1","slug":"2020-11-25-15-52-korean-1","date":"2020-11-25T07:52:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.265Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-52-korean-1/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-52-korean-1/","excerpt":"","text":"Sejong Korean 1한국어와 한글한국어 한국어는 한국의 공용어이다. 한국어를 사용하는 인구는 한반도에 거주하는 인구와 해외 한국계 한국어는 사용 인구로 볼 때 세계 13위 안에 드는 언어이다. 언어별 인터넷 사용자 수 순위에서 한국어 사용자는 세계 10위 안에 든다. 한글 한글은 한국어를 표기하는 문자이다. 한글은 세종대왕이 1443년에 창제하였다. 그때 이름은 훈민정음 이었다. 한글 창제 이전에는 지식인층을 중심으로 한자로 문자 생활을 하였으나, 한글이 창제되면서 일반 사람들도 문자 생활이 가능해졌다. 한글과 한국어는 엄연히 다릅니다. 우리가 지금 말하는 언어는 ‘한국어’입니다. 이 ‘한국어’를 표기하는 문자가 ‘한글’인 것이구요. 미국 사람들이 말하는 것은 ‘영어’입니다. 이 ‘영어’를 표기하는 문자가 ‘알파벳(로마자)인 것이구요. 즉, 한글,한국어,영어,알파벳의 관계를 살펴보면 이렇습니다. 한국어를 한글로 쓴 경우 (안녕하세요.) 한국어를 알파벳으로 쓴 경우 (An nyeong ha se yo.) 영어를 한글로 쓴 경우 (헬로우!) 영어를 알파벳으로 쓴 경우 (Hello!) 결국 세종대왕이 한글을 창제하기 이전에 우리들의 언어는 한국어였습니다. 다만 이 한국어를 표기할 문자가 없었기 때문에 한문을 이용한 것입니다. 그런데 이 한문이 너무 어렵고 우리 한국어를 표기하는데 적합하지 않다고 생각하여 세종대왕께서 한글창제를 기획하신 것입니다.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"韩语 한글","slug":"韩语-한글","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E9%9F%A9%E8%AF%AD-%ED%95%9C%EA%B8%80/"}]},{"title":"Korean 韩语入门 2","slug":"2020-11-25-15-43-korean-2","date":"2020-11-25T07:43:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.262Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-43-korean-2/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-43-korean-2/","excerpt":"","text":"Sejong Korean 2한글 자모자모와 음절 교착어(膠着語): 실질적인 의미를 가진 단어 또는 어간에 문법적인 기능을 가진 요소가 붙어 쓰이는 언어. 한국어·일본어·터키어·핀란드어 따위. &lt;동의어&gt; 부착어. 첨가어. 굴절어(屈折語): 어미의 변화에 의하여 성, 수, 격 등의 문법적 기능을 나타내는 성질의 언어. 인도 게르만 어족과 셈어족이 이에 딸림. 셈어족: 히브리어, 아랍어, 페니키아어 등 북부 아프리카에서 서남 아시아에 걸쳐 쓰이는 말을 통틀어 이르는 말. 고립어(孤立語): 단어는 실질적 의미를 나타낼 뿐 어미 변화나 접사가 없고, 문법적 기능은 주로 어순에 따라 나타내는 언어. 중국어, 티베트어, 타이어가 대표적임. 포합어(抱合語): 동사를 중심으로 그 앞뒤에 인칭이나 목적을 나타내는 말이 결합 또는 삽입되어, 한 말로서 한 문장과 같은 형태를 가지는 말. 아메리카 인디언의 말이나 아이누어, 에스키모어가 이에 딸림. 가장 일반적인 방법은 계통적으로 분류하여 어족(語族)으로 묶는 것이다. 기원적으로 동일한 언어로부터 가라져 나온 둘 이상의 언어가 오랜세월 동안 서로 다른 언어 환경 속에서 변천을 거듭하여 각기 다른 개별언어를 형성하였을 때 이들 언어를 공통조어(共通祖語)를 갖고 있는 동계어(同系語) 또는 친족관계에 있는 하나의 어족에 속하는 언어라 분류한다. 세계 어족은 다음과 같다. 인-구어족(게르만어족, 겔트어족, 로만스어족, 슬라부어족, 이란어족, 인도어족 등) 피노우그리어족(핀랜드어, 에스토니아어, 헝가리어, 래프랜드어) 알타이어족(터어키, 몽고, 만주어족) 바스크어족(바스크어) 아시아-아프리카어족(셈, 이집트어족 등) 니제르-콩고어족 한-일어족(한국어, 일본어) 중국-티베트어족(티베트, 버어마어족, 중국어족) 카다이어족(타이, 라오스, 샨어) 말레이-폴리네시아어족(인도네시아어족, 하와이, 사모아어 등) 오스트렐리아어족(왈비리어) 드라비다어족(타밀, 곤드어) 오스트리아-아시아어족(카스, 문다. 크메르, 베트남어) 아메리칸 인디아어족","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"韩语 한글","slug":"韩语-한글","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E9%9F%A9%E8%AF%AD-%ED%95%9C%EA%B8%80/"}]},{"title":"Korean 韩语入门 3","slug":"2020-11-25-15-25-korean-3","date":"2020-11-25T07:25:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T06:55:02.260Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-25-korean-3/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-25-korean-3/","excerpt":"Sejong Korean 3유용한 표현 一. 不需要隔寫的情況 助詞與前面的名詞不隔寫 &lt;1&gt; 名詞+助詞（이/가/를/부터/에서等等） &lt;2&gt; 名詞+이다 &lt;3&gt; 雙引號“ ”+라고 依存名詞和助詞不隔寫 名詞+助詞(밖에, 만큼, 만, 대로, 뿐) 例句： 집에 다른 것 없고 만두만 있어요. 家裡沒有其他的東西只有餃子。 그녀가 가수만큼 노래를 잘 불러요. 那個女的唱歌和歌手一樣好聽。 교실에 사람이 한 명밖에 없다. 教室裡只有一個人。 그냥 생각대로 말해봐. 想什麼就說什麼。 나는 원하는 것이 네 마음뿐이다. 我想要的不過就是你的心。 ⭑ 但是當與(는,ㄴ,ㄹ)連用時需要空格。 例如：그럴 뿐, 먹을 만큼, 먹을 만 動詞與詞尾不隔寫 例句： 저는 주말에 집에서 공부하고 TV를 본다. 我週末在家學習和看電視。 우리 서로 사랑해서 결혼을 합시다. 我們互相愛著對方，所以結婚吧！ 보기 쉬운데 막상해보니 너무 어려워요. 看起來很簡單，仔細一想實在是太難了。 집에 청소해야 되는데 시간이 부족해서 그냥 놓고 나왔어요. 家裡其實要搞衛生的，時間不夠就直接出來了。 助詞與助詞相連不隔寫 例句： 도서관에서처럼 조용해라.

A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death. Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness. The series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal, but at the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that as a baby, his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school’s potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry’s confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher’s Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describes Harry’s second year at Hogwarts. Students are attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle parentage are the primary targets. The attacks appear related to the Chamber of Secrets, a fifty-year-old mystery at the school. Harry discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which he learns is rare and associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione is attacked, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber’s secrets and enter it. Harry discovers that the chamber was opened by Ron’s younger sister, Ginny Weasley, who was possessed by an old diary in her belongings. The memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort’s younger self, resided inside the diary and unleashed the basilisk, an ancient monster that kills those who make direct eye contact. Harry draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, slays the basilisk and destroys the diary. In the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted by Sirius Black, an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his parents’ murder. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – creatures guarding the school that feed on despair – he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a black dog into the Shrieking Shack; Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed to be Sirius Black. Lupin enters the shack and explains that Black was James Potter’s best friend; he was framed by Peter Pettigrew, who hides as Ron’s pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin transforms into a werewolf and bounds away; the group chase after him but are surrounded by dementors. They are saved by a mysterious figure who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a future version of Harry, who traveled back in time with Hermione using the Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a Hippogriff.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"英语 English","slug":"英语-English","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD-English/"}]},{"title":"Slang Words 俚语","slug":"2020-11-19-01-56-slang-words","date":"2020-11-18T17:56:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T07:57:18.619Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/19/2020-11-19-01-56-slang-words/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/19/2020-11-19-01-56-slang-words/","excerpt":"Slang is language of an informal register that members of particular in-groups prefer over the common vocabulary of a standard language in order to establish group identity, exclude outsiders, or both.

Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: Debt restructuring means lenders get paid back less or get paid back over a longer time frame or at a lower interest rate that was first agreed. Somehow a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt. Lenders would rather have a little of something than all of nothing. Even though debt disappears, debt restructuring causes income and asset values to disappear faster, so the debt burden continues to gets worse. Like cutting spending, debt reduction is also painful and deflationary. All of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment means the government collects fewer taxes. At the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen. Many of the unemployed have inadequate savings and need financial support from the government. Additionally, governments create stimulus plans and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy. Governments’ budget deficits explode in a deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes. This is what is happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news. To fund their deficits, governments need to either raise taxes or borrow money. But with incomes falling and so many unemployed, who is the money going to come from? The rich. Since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people, governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy - from the ‘haves’ to the ‘have nots’. The ‘have-nots,’ who are suffering, begin to resent the wealthy ‘haves.’ The wealthy ‘haves,’ being squeezed by the weak economy, falling asset prices, higher taxes, begin to resent the ‘have nots.’ If the depression continues social disorder can break out. Not only do tensions rise within countries, they can rise between countries - especially debtor and creditor countries. This situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme. In the 1930s, this led to Hitler coming to power, war in Europe, and depression in the United States. Pressure to do something to end the depression increases. Remember, most of what people thought was money was actually credit. So, when credit disappears, people don’t have enough money. People are desperate for money and you remember who can print money? The Central Bank can. Having already lowered its interest rates to nearly 0 - it’s forced to print money. Unlike cutting spending, debt reduction, and wealth redistribution, printing money is inflationary and stimulative. Inevitably, the central bank prints new money — out of thin air — and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds. It happened in the United States during the Great Depression and again in 2008, when the United States’ central bank — the Federal Reserve — printed over two trillion dollars. Other central banks around the world that could, printed a lot of money, too. By buying financial assets with this money, it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more creditworthy. However, this only helps those who own financial assets. You see, the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets. The Central Government, on the other hand, can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people but it can’t print money. So, in order to stimulate the economy, the two must cooperate. By buying government bonds, the Central Bank essentially lends money to the government, allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending on goods and services through its stimulus programs and unemployment benefits. This increases people’s income as well as the government’s debt. However, it will lower the economy’s total debt burden. This is a very risky time. Policy makers need to balance the four ways that debt burdens come down. The deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in order to maintain stability. If balanced correctly, there can be a Beautiful Deleveraging. You see, a deleveraging can be ugly or it can be beautiful. How can a deleveraging be beautiful? Even though a deleveraging is a difficult situation, handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful. A lot more beautiful than the debt-fueled, unbalanced excesses of the leveraging phase. In a beautiful deleveraging, debts decline relative to income, real economic growth is positive, and inflation isn’t a problem. It is achieved by having the right balance. The right balance requires a certain mix of cutting spending, reducing debt, transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained. People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won’t if it offsets falling credit. Remember, spending is what matters. A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on price as a dollar of spending paid for with credit. By printing money, the Central Bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money. In order to turn things around, the Central Bank needs to not only pump up income growth but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the accumulated debt. So, what do I mean by that? Basically, income needs to grow faster than debt grows. For example: let’s assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to- income ratio of 100%. That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year. Now think about the interest rate on that debt, let’s say it is 2%. If debt is growing at 2% because of that interest rate and income is only growing at around only 1%, you will never reduce the debt burden. You need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the rate of interest. However, printing money can easily be abused because it’s so easy to do and people prefer it to the alternatives. The key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptably high inflation, the way Germany did during its deleveraging in the 1920’s. If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn’t so dramatic. Growth is slow but debt burdens go down. That’s a beautiful deleveraging. When incomes begin to rise, borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy. And when borrowers appear more creditworthy, lenders begin to lend money again. Debt burdens finally begin to fall. Able to borrow money, people can spend more. Eventually, the economy begins to grow again, leading to the reflation phase of the long term debt cycle. Though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly, if handled well, it will eventually fix the problem. It takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal - hence the term ‘lost decade.’ Of course, the economy is a little more complicated than this template suggests. However, laying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycle and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we’ve been, where we are now and where we are probably headed. So in summary, there are three rules of thumb that I’d like you to take away from this: First: Don’t have debt rise faster than income, because your debt burdens will eventually crush you. Second: Don’t have income rise faster than productivity, because you will eventually become uncompetitive. And third: Do all that you can to raise your productivity, because, in the long run, that’s what matters most. This is simple advice for you and it’s simple advice for policy makers.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"Inflation 通货膨胀","slug":"2020-11-15-17-30-inflation","date":"2020-11-15T09:30:00.000Z","updated":"2022-07-06T12:07:34.730Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/15/2020-11-15-17-30-inflation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/15/2020-11-15-17-30-inflation/","excerpt":"Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time.

Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: In an economy without credit: the only way to increase your spending is to produce more. But in an economy with credit, you can also increase your spending by borrowing. As a result, an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run, but not over the long run. Now, don’t get me wrong, credit isn’t necessarily something bad that just causes cycles. It’s bad when it finances over-consumption that can’t be paid back. However, it’s good when it efficiently allocates resources and produces income so you can pay back the debt. For example, if you borrow money to buy a big TV, it doesn’t generate income for you to pay back the debt. But, if you borrow money to buy a tractor — and that tractor let’s you harvest more crops and earn more money — then, you can pay back your debt and improve your living standards. In an economy with credit, we can follow the transactions and see how credit creates growth. Let me give you an example: Suppose you earn $100,000 a year and have no debt. You are creditworthy enough to borrow $10,000 dollars - say on a credit card - so you can spend $110,000 dollars even though you only earn $100,000 dollars. Since your spending is another person’s income, someone is earning $110,000 dollars. The person earning $110,000 dollars with no debt can borrow $11,000 dollars, so he can spend $121,000 dollars even though he has only earned $110,000 dollars. His spending is another person’s income and by following the transactions we can begin to see how this process works in a self-reinforcing pattern. But remember, borrowing creates cycles and if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down. This leads us into the Short Term Debt Cycle. As economic activity increases, we see an expansion - the first phase of the short term debt cycle. Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise. This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit - which can be created instantly out of thin air. When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods: prices rise. When prices rise, we call this inflation. The Central Bank doesn’t want too much inflation because it causes problems. Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates. With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money. And the cost of existing debts rises. Think about this as the monthly payments on your credit card going up. Because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments, they have less money leftover to spend, so spending slows and since one person’s spending is another person’s income, incomes drop and so on and so forth. When people spend less, prices go down. We call this deflation. Economic activity decreases and we have a recession. If the recession becomes too severe and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again. With low interest rates, debt repayments are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up and we see another expansion. As you can see, the economy works like a machine. In the short term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there’s an economic expansion. When credit isn’t easily available, there’s a recession. And note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank. The short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 - 8 years and happens over and over again for decades. But notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt. Why? Because people push it — they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt. It’s human nature. Because of this, over long periods of time, debts rise faster than incomes creating the Long Term Debt Cycle. Despite people becoming more indebted, lenders even more freely extend credit. Why? Because everybody thinks things are going great! People are just focusing on what’s been happening lately. And what has been happening lately? Incomes have been rising! Asset values are going up! The stock market roars! It’s a boom! It pays to buy goods, services, and financial assets with borrowed money! When people do a lot of that, we call it a bubble. So even though debts have been growing, incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them. Let’s call the ratio of debt-to-income the debt burden. So long as incomes continue to rise, the debt burden stays manageable. At the same time asset values soar. People borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher. People feel wealthy. So even with the accumulation of lots of debt, rising incomes and asset values help borrowers remain creditworthy for a long time. But this obviously can not continue forever. And it doesn’t. Over decades, debt burdens slowly increase creating larger and larger debt repayments. At some point, debt repayments start growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending. And since one person’s spending is another person’s income, incomes begin to go down which makes people less creditworthy causing borrowing to go down. Debt repayments continue to rise which makes spending drop even further and the cycle reverses itself. This is the long term debt peak. Debt burdens have simply become too big. For the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world this happened in 2008. It happened for the same reason it happened in Japan in 1989 and in the United States back in 1929. Now the economy begins Deleveraging. In a deleveraging; people cut spending, incomes fall, credit disappears, assets prices drop, banks get squeezed, the stock market crashes, social tensions rise and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way. As incomes fall and debt repayments rise, borrowers get squeezed. No longer creditworthy, credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt repayments. Scrambling to fill this hole, borrowers are forced to sell assets. The rush to sell assets floods the market. This is when the stock market collapses, the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble. As asset prices drop, the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops. This makes borrowers even less creditworthy. People feel poor. Credit rapidly disappears. Less spending › less income › less wealth › less credit › less borrowing and so on. It’s a vicious cycle. This appears similar to a recession but the difference here is that interest rates can’t be lowered to save the day. In a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate the borrowing. However, in a deleveraging, lowering interest rates doesn’t work because interest rates are already low and soon hit 0% - so the stimulation ends. Interest rates in the United States hit 0% during the deleveraging of the 1930s and again in 2008. The difference between a recession and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging borrowers’ debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can’t be relieved by lowering interest rates. Lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back. Borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value. They feel crippled by the debt - they don’t even want more! Lenders stop lending. Borrowers stop borrowing. Think of the economy as being not-creditworthy, just like an individual. So what do you do about a deleveraging? The problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down. There are four ways this can happen: people, businesses, and governments cut their spending. debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings. wealth is redistributed from the ‘haves’ to the ‘have nots’. and finally, the central bank prints new money. These 4 ways have happened in every deleveraging in modern history. Usually, spending is cut first. As we just saw, people, businesses, banks and even governments tighten their belts and cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt. This is often referred to as austerity. When borrowers stop taking on new debts, and start paying down old debts, you might expect the debt burden to decrease. But the opposite happens! Because spending is cut - and one man’s spending is another man’s income - it causes incomes to fall. They fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse. As we’ve seen, this cut in spending is deflationary and painful. Businesses are forced to cut costs which means less jobs and higher unemployment. This leads to the next step: debts must be reduced! Many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans — and a borrower’s debts are a lender’s assets. When borrowers don’t repay the bank, people get nervous that the bank won’t be able to repay them so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank. Banks get squeezed and people, businesses and banks default on their debts. This severe economic contraction is a depression. A big part of a depression is people discovering much of what they thought was their wealth isn’t really there.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"Transaction 交易","slug":"2020-11-15-17-23-transaction","date":"2020-11-15T09:23:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-21T10:33:11.128Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/15/2020-11-15-17-23-transaction/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/15/2020-11-15-17-23-transaction/","excerpt":"A transaction is a completed agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange goods, services, or financial assets.

Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: An economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing. You make transactions all the time. Every time you buy something you create a transaction. Each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods, services or financial assets. Credit spends just like money, so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent, you can know the total spending. The total amount of spending drives the economy. If you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold, you get the price. And that’s it. That’s a transaction. It is the building block of the economic machine. All cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions. So, if we can understand transactions, we can understand the whole economy. A market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing. For example, there is a wheat market, a car market, a stock market and markets for millions of things. An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets. If you add up the total spending and the total quantity sold in all of the markets, you have everything you need to know to understand the economy. It’s just that simple. People, businesses, banks and governments all engage in transactions the way I just described: exchanging money and credit for goods, services and financial assets. The biggest buyer and seller is the government, which consists of two important parts: a Central Government that collects taxes and spends money and a Central Bank, which is different from other buyers and sellers because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy. It does this by influencing interest rates and printing new money. For these reasons, as we’ll see, the Central Bank is an important player in the flow of Credit.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"Principles for Success 成功的原理（1-4）","slug":"2020-11-13-13-36-principles-for-success-1-4","date":"2020-11-13T05:36:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-21T10:33:11.128Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-36-principles-for-success-1-4/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-36-principles-for-success-1-4/","excerpt":"by Ray Dalio The Call to Adventure Before we begin, let me just establish the fact that I don’t know much relative to what I need to know. Whatever success I’ve had in life has more to do with my knowing how to deal with my not knowing than anything I know. That I should be telling other people what to do sounds kind of presumptuous to me. But I’m going to do it because I believe that the principles that have made me successful could help other achieve their own goals. I’m now at a stage in my own life in which it is much more important to me to pass along what I’ve learned about how to be successful than to seek more success for myself. What you choose to do with these principles is up to you. You have to be an independent thinker because only you can develop your own principles based on your own values. This brings me to my first and most fundamental principle which is that you need to think for yourself about what is true. So let’s get started. Early on, I’ve discovered I needed principles. Principles are smart ways for handling things that happen over and over again in similar situations. There are principles for everything. From skiing, to parenting, to cooking, and so on. I’m going to share some of my most important overarching life principles that influence how we approach everything that we do. I didn’t start out with principles, I acquired them over a lifetime of experiences. Mostly from making mistakes and reflecting on them. My life principles are simple but they’re not complete. I still struggle to make the best decisions and I still make mistakes and learn new principles all the time. This is the reality. At the beginning, I needed to escape the conventions that surrounded me which meant that I needed to think for myself. Unless you want to have a life that is directed by others, you need to decide for yourself what to do and you need to have the courage to do it. But I didn’t know that at first. I only learned that from going on my adventure. Looking back on my own journey, I now see that time is like a river, that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can’t stop our movement down this river and we can’t avoid the encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way. In your lifetime, you will face millions of decisions. The quality of your decisions will determine the quality of your life. Over the course of my lifetime, the most valuable things I’ve learned were the results of mistakes I’ve reflected on to help form principles so I wouldn’t make the same mistakes again. These principles took me from being a very ordinary middle-class kid from Long Island to becoming very successful as judged by conventional measures. They also gave me the meaningful work and meaningful relationships that I value even more than these conventional successes. People often ask me how I did it. I can assure you it wasn’t because of my uniqueness as a person. It was the result of a unique approach to life I believe almost anybody can adopt. It starts with embracing reality and dealing with it.","text":"by Ray Dalio The Call to Adventure Before we begin, let me just establish the fact that I don’t know much relative to what I need to know. Whatever success I’ve had in life has more to do with my knowing how to deal with my not knowing than anything I know. That I should be telling other people what to do sounds kind of presumptuous to me. But I’m going to do it because I believe that the principles that have made me successful could help other achieve their own goals. I’m now at a stage in my own life in which it is much more important to me to pass along what I’ve learned about how to be successful than to seek more success for myself. What you choose to do with these principles is up to you. You have to be an independent thinker because only you can develop your own principles based on your own values. This brings me to my first and most fundamental principle which is that you need to think for yourself about what is true. So let’s get started. Early on, I’ve discovered I needed principles. Principles are smart ways for handling things that happen over and over again in similar situations. There are principles for everything. From skiing, to parenting, to cooking, and so on. I’m going to share some of my most important overarching life principles that influence how we approach everything that we do. I didn’t start out with principles, I acquired them over a lifetime of experiences. Mostly from making mistakes and reflecting on them. My life principles are simple but they’re not complete. I still struggle to make the best decisions and I still make mistakes and learn new principles all the time. This is the reality. At the beginning, I needed to escape the conventions that surrounded me which meant that I needed to think for myself. Unless you want to have a life that is directed by others, you need to decide for yourself what to do and you need to have the courage to do it. But I didn’t know that at first. I only learned that from going on my adventure. Looking back on my own journey, I now see that time is like a river, that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can’t stop our movement down this river and we can’t avoid the encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way. In your lifetime, you will face millions of decisions. The quality of your decisions will determine the quality of your life. Over the course of my lifetime, the most valuable things I’ve learned were the results of mistakes I’ve reflected on to help form principles so I wouldn’t make the same mistakes again. These principles took me from being a very ordinary middle-class kid from Long Island to becoming very successful as judged by conventional measures. They also gave me the meaningful work and meaningful relationships that I value even more than these conventional successes. People often ask me how I did it. I can assure you it wasn’t because of my uniqueness as a person. It was the result of a unique approach to life I believe almost anybody can adopt. It starts with embracing reality and dealing with it. Embrace Reality and Deal With ItThe path you take in life is your most important decision. In my case, I wanted my life to be great and I feared boredom and mediocrity more than I feared failure. Since I didn’t start out with money, and I didn’t need much more than a bed to sleep in and food to eat, I could skew my decisions to pursue my adventures. So ever since I was a kid, I ran after the things I wanted, crashed, got up and ran again, and crashed again. And each time I crashed I learned something, got better, and crashed less. By doing that over and over again, I learned to love this process, even the crashing part of it. Through it, I encountered reality, and I learned how to deal with it, which inspired another one of my most fundamental principles which is that truth is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes. By truth, I don’t mean anything more than the way the world works. I believe that we were given the laws of reality by nature. Humans didn’t create them, but we can use them to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals. Realizing that made me a hyperrealist, by which I mean I became someone who has discovered the great rewards of deeply understanding, accepting, and working with reality as it is and not as I wish it would be. When I say I’m a hyperrealist, people sometimes think I’m saying that dreams can’t come true. That’s absolutely not true. Without pursuing dreams, life is mundane. What I mean is that to me, hyperrealism is the best way to choose one’s dreams and then achieve them. Having big dreams plus embracing reality plus having lots of determination will bring you a successful life. I believe this formula is true for everyone, but what does a successful life look like? We each have to decide for ourselves what success is. I don’t care whether you want to be a master of the universe or to live under a palm tree or anything else. I really don’t. Each of us chooses goals based on our values and decides on the best path to achieve them, but we all need approaches to making decisions that work well, especially when facing problems, mistakes, and weaknesses that stand in our way. To succeed, we must embrace all our realities, especially the harsh realities that we wish weren’t true. At first, looking at these harsh realities caused me a lot of pain, but I learned that this pain was just psychological and that by seeing things differently made all the difference. I came to view problems like puzzles that would reward me if I could solve them. They would help me deal with the problem at hand, and they would give me principles for dealing with similar problems in the future. I learned to treat pain as a cue that a great learning opportunity is at hand, which led me to realize that pain plus reflection equals progress. Meditation has been invaluable in helping me see things that way. I found that when I calmed myself down and embraced my realities and dealt with them, the rewards brought me pleasure and the pain faded. Each of us has the unique capability to think logically to reflect on ourselves and our circumstances and to direct our own personal evolution. Doing this well is just a matter of following a simple five-step process. In episode three, we’ll explore what that process is and how to use it. The Five Step ProcessWe’ve discussed how important it is to reflect carefully after experiencing pain. When I did this, I was usually able to discover principles that would prevent me from repeating the same mistakes in the future, and I could see that being successful simply consisted of five steps. Step one is to know your goals and run after them. What is best for you depends on your nature, so you need to really understand yourself and know what you want to achieve in life. Step two is to encounter the problems that stand in the way of getting to your goals. These problems are typically painful. If handled badly, some of them can lead to your ruin. But to evolve, you need to identify those problems and not tolerate them. Step three is to diagnose these problems to get at their root causes. Don’t jump too quickly to solutions. Take a step back and reflect in order to really distinguish the symptoms from the disease. Step four is to design a plan to eliminate the problems. This is where you will determine what you need to do to get around them. And step five is to execute those designs, pushing yourself to do what’s needed to progress towards your goal. A successful life essentially consists of doing these five steps over and over again. This is your personal evolution, and you see this process everywhere. It’s just a law of nature. Think of any product, any organization, or any person you know, and you will see that this is true for them. Evolution is simply a process of either adapting or dying. Conceptually, it looks just like the five step process I’ve described. As you push through this often painful process, you’ll naturally ascend to higher and higher levels of success. I’ve found that when I did it better, my struggling never became easier because the more capable I became, the greater the challenges I would take on. Because different people are strong and weak at different things, most people can’t do all five steps well. Not facing this reality means you could stretch further than you should, and as the heights get greater, your falls could also be greater. Sometimes terrible things happen to all of us in life. They can ruin us, or they can profoundly improve us, depending on how we handle them. Something like this happened to me in 1982. In episode four, I’ll show you what happened and the lessons I learned. The AbyssWe progress forward until we encounter setbacks. Whether or not we get out of them and continue forward or spiral downward depends on whether or not we’re willing to face the failure objectively and make the right decisions to turn the loop upward again. Something terrible happened to me in 1982, when I bet everything on a depression that never came. The period between 1979 and 1982 was one of extreme turbulence. For the global economy, the markets, and for me. And I believed that the U.S. economy, with the world economy tied to it, was headed toward a catastrophe. This view was extremely controversial. I wanted the great upside and very publicly took a big risk and was wrong. Dead wrong. After a delay, the stock market began a big bull market that lasted 18 years and the U.S. economy enjoyed the greatest growth period in its history. This experience was like a blow to my head with a baseball bat. I had to cut my losses so that my company, Bridgewater, was left with one employee: Me. I was so broke, I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad to pay my bills, but even worse was having to let go the people I cared so much about. I wondered whether I should give up my dream of working for myself and play it safe by working for someone else in a job that would require me to put on a tie and commute every day. Though I knew that, for me, taking less risk would mean having a less great life. Being so wrong, and especially being so publicly wrong, was painfully humbling. I am still shocked and embarrassed by how arrogant I was in being totally confident in a totally incorrect view. Though I’d been right much more than I’d been wrong, I had let one bad bet erase all my good ones. I thought very hard about the relationship between risk and reward and how to manage them, but I couldn’t see a path forward that would give me the rewards I wanted without unacceptable risk. This kind of experience happens to everyone. It will happen to you. You will lose something or someone you think you can’t live without. Or you will suffer a terrible illness or injury. Or your career will fall apart before your eyes. You might think that your life is ruined and that there’s no way to go forward, but it will pass. I assure you that there is always a best path forward and you probably just don’t see it yet. You just have to reflect well to find it. You have to embrace your reality.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"英语 English","slug":"英语-English","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD-English/"}]},{"title":"Principles for Success 成功的原理（5-8）","slug":"2020-11-13-13-29-principles-for-success-5-8","date":"2020-11-13T05:29:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-21T10:33:11.128Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-29-principles-for-success-5-8/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-29-principles-for-success-5-8/","excerpt":"by Ray Dalio Everything is a MachineSometimes things happen that are hard to understand. Life often feels so difficult and complicated. It’s too much to take in all at once. My deep pain led me to reflect deeply on my circumstances. It also led me to reflect on nature, because it provides a guide for what’s true. So I thought a lot about how things work, which helped to put me and my own circumstances in perspective. I saw that at the Big Bang, all the laws and forces of the universe were created and propelled forward, interacting with each other as a perpetual motion machine in which all the bits and pieces coalesce into machines that work for awhile, fall apart, and then coalesce into new machines. This goes on into eternity. I saw that everything is a machine. The structure and evolution of galaxies, the formation of our own solar system, the makeup of Earth’s geography and ecosystems, our economies and markets, and each of us, we individually are machines made up of different machines, our circulatory system, our nervous system that produce our thoughts, our dreams, our emotions, and all the other aspects of our distinct characters. All of these different machines evolve together through time to produce the realities we encounter every day. And I realized that I was just one tiny bit in one nanosecond deciding what I should do. While that perspective might sound very philosophical, I found that it was very practical because it showed me how I could deal with my own realities in a better way. For example, I observed that most everything happens over and over again in slightly different ways, some in obvious short term cycles that are easy to recognize so we know how to deal with them, like the 24 hour day, some so infrequently that they haven’t occurred in our lifetimes, and we’re shocked when they do, like the once in a hundred year storm, and some we know exist but are encountering for the first time, like the birth of our first child. Most people mistakenly treat these situations as being unique and deal with them without having proper perspective or principles to help them get through them. I found that if instead of dealing with these events as one offs, I could see each as just another one of those and approach them in the same way a biologist might approach an animal, first identifying its species, then drawing on principles for dealing with it appropriately. Because I could see these events transpire in pretty much the same ways over and over, I could more clearly see the cause-effect relationships that govern their behaviors, which allowed me to develop better principles that I could express in both words and algorithms. I learned that while most everyone expects the future to be a slightly modified version of the present, it is typically very different. That’s because people are biased by recent history and overlook events that haven’t happened in a long time, perhaps not even in their lifetime, but they will happen again. With that perspective, I realize that what I missed when I mistakenly called for a Great Depression was hidden in the patterns of history and I could use my newfound knowledge of these patterns to make better decisions in the future. And when I thought about my challenge balancing risk and reward, I realized that risk and reward naturally go together. I could see that to get the most out of life, one has to take more risks and that knowing how to appropriately balance risk and reward is essential to having the best life possible. Imagine you are faced with a choice of having a safe boring life if you stay where you are or having a fabulous one if you take the risk of successfully crossing a dangerous jungle. That is essentially the choice we all face. For me, the choice was clear, but that doesn’t mean the path forward was without challenges. I still needed to face two big barriers that we all must face.","text":"by Ray Dalio Everything is a MachineSometimes things happen that are hard to understand.

That is essentially the choice we all face. For me, the choice was clear, but that doesn’t mean the path forward was without challenges. I still needed to face two big barriers that we all must face. Your Two Biggest BarriersI can’t tell you which path in life is best for you because I don’t know how important it is for you to achieve big goals relative to how important it is for you to avoid the pains required to get them. This is the courage I spoke of earlier and we each have to feel these things out for ourselves. After my big mistake in calling for a depression, I had come to one of life’s forks in the road as we all do. If I made the choice to take a normal job and play it safe, I would have ended up with a very different life than the one I had. But as long as I can pay the rent, put food on the table, and educate my kids, the only choice for me was to risk crossing the jungle in pursuit of the best life possible. My big mistake in betting on a depression gave me a healthy fear of being wrong, in other words, it gave me deep humility, which was exactly what I needed. At the same time, it didn’t stop me from aggressively going after the things I wanted. To succeed, I needed to see more than I alone can see. But standing in my way of doing that were the two biggest barriers everyone faces: our ego and blind spot barriers. These barriers exist because of how our brains work. First, let’s explore the ego barrier. When I refer to your ego barrier, I’m talking about the parts of your brain that prevent you from acknowledging your weaknesses objectively so that you can figure out how to deal with it. Your deepest-seated needs and fears reside in areas of your brain that control your emotions and are not accessible to your higher level conscious awareness and because our need to be right can be more important than our need to find out what’s true, we like to believe our own opinions without properly stress testing them. We especially don’t like to look at our mistakes and weaknesses. We are instinctively prone to react to explorations of them as though they’re attacks. We get angry, even though it would be more logical for us to be open to feedback from others. This leads to our making inferior decisions, learning less, and falling short of our potentials. The second is the blind spot barrier. Everyone has blind spots. The blind spot barrier is when a person believes he or she can see everything, but it’s a simple fact that no one alone can see a complete picture of reality. Naturally people can’t appreciate what they can’t see, just as we all have different ranges for singing, hearing pitch, and seeing colors, we have different ranges for seeing and understanding things. For example, while some people are better at seeing the big picture, others excel at seeing details. Some are linear thinkers and others are more lateral. While some are creative but not reliable, others are reliable but not creative, and so on. Because of how our brains are wired differently, everyone perceives the world around them differently. By doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weaknesses and we crash. Either we keep doing that or we change. Aristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person’s fatal flaw. A flaw that, had it been fixed, would have instead led to a wonderful outcome. In my opinion, these two barriers are the main impediments that get in the way of good decision-making. My fear of being wrong gave me the radical open-mindedness I needed and that changed everything. Be Radically Open-MindedTaking risks and occasionally being ruined wasn’t acceptable, and neither was not taking risks, and not having exceptional results. I needed an approach that would give me the exceptional upside without also giving me the exceptional downside. When I discovered it, it turned out to be my holy grail. To get it, I needed to replace the joy of being proven right with the joy of learning what’s true. This need prompted me to seek out the most thoughtful people I could find who disagreed with me. I didn’t care about their conclusions, I just wanted to see things through their eyes, and to have them see things through my eyes, so that together, we could hash things out to discover what’s true. In other words, what I wanted most from them was thoughtful disagreement, going from seeing things through just my eyes to seeing things through the eyes of these thoughtful people was like going from seeing things in black and white to seeing them in color. The world lit up! That’s when I realized that the best way to go through the jungle of life is with insightful people who see things differently from me. Think about the five step process I described earlier. As I said, because we are wired so differently, not everyone can do all the five steps well, but you don’t have to do them all alone. You can get help from others who are good at what you’re not, who are wired to perceive things you can’t. All you need to do is let go of your attachment to having the right answers yourself, and use your fear of being wrong to become open-minded to these other views. In this way, you could point out the risks and opportunities that you would individually miss. I found that taking this radically open-minded approach and believability weighting people’s thinking significantly increased my probabilities of making the best decisions possible. This enabled me to ascend to greater heights and greater challenges. In the past, I would have always wanted to do what I myself thought was best, but now I sought out the strongest independent thinkers I could find, I still do. There is nothing better to be on shared mission with extraordinary people who can be radically truthful, and radically transparent with each other. This approach led me to create a company with a unique idea meritocracy, operating in a unique way that produced unique successes. In an idea meritocracy, you get the best of everybody. Everyone thinks independently, then we work through our disagreements to get at what’s best. However, not every opinion is equally valuable, and we had to learn to distinguish between good ideas and bad ones to get the best decisions. In other words, we needed to believability weight people’s thinking. But that’s another story I will explain in my work principles. Right now, there are many wonderful opportunities and dangerous risks surrounding you that you don’t see. If you saw them free of the distortions produced by your ego or your blind spots, you would be able to deal with them more effectively. If you could acquire this ability, and with practice you can, you will radically improve your life. Struggle WellSo far, I described how I learned to confront my own realities, my problems, my mistakes and weaknesses, and how I surrounded myself with others who could do things better than I could. This was the most effective way I discovered for making great decisions. This is not the normal way of being but through this approach, I became very successful. And being successful enabled me to meet extraordinarily successful people and see how they think. I’ve discovered that their journeys were similar to mine. You might not know it but they all struggle and they all have weaknesses. That they all get around by working with people who see risks and opportunities that they would miss. Over time, I learned that by nature most people’s greatest strengths are also connected to their most significant weaknesses. And striving hard for big things is bound to lead you to painful falls. It’s just part of the process. Such setbacks will test you. They sort people. Some think hard about what caused their setbacks, learned lessons, and continue progressing toward their goals. While others decide that this game is not for them and get off the field, I’ve come to realize that success is not a matter of attaining one’s goals. I found that when I reached each new higher level of success, I really remained satisfied. The things we’re striving for are just the bait. Struggling to get them forces us to evolve. And it is this struggle to our personal evolution with others that is the reward. I no longer wanted to get across the jungle but instead wanted to find greater and greater challenges to go after. Surrounded by great people working together on a shared journey. Eventually, the success of the mission and the well-being of the people alongside me became more important than my own success. I also started to see beyond myself and wanted others to be successful when I’m no longer here. I realized that if I failed to do that, I will be a failure. I struggle with this now. We all struggle with different things at different times until we either choose to give up or until we die and become part of the larger evolutionary story. This is how all machines work and are recycled through time. When a machine breaks down, it’s parts go back into the system to become parts of new machines that also evolved through time. Sometimes this makes us sad because we become very attached to our machines. But if you look at it from a higher level, it’s really beautiful to observe how the machine of evolution works. Now you must decide for yourself how you will evolve. Forget about where these principles came from. Just assess whether or not they are useful to you and evolve them to sooth your own needs. As with all of life’s decisions, what you do with them is ultimately up to you. My only hope for you is that you have the courage to struggle and evolve well to make your life as great as it can be.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"英语 English","slug":"英语-English","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD-English/"}]},{"title":"Presidential Election 总统选举","slug":"2020-11-13-10-06-presidential-election","date":"2020-11-13T02:06:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T18:27:17.702Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/13/2020-11-13-10-06-presidential-election/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/13/2020-11-13-10-06-presidential-election/","excerpt":"In the U.S., no one is required by law to vote in any local, state, or presidential election.

When the already tense White is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he breaks down and turns to a life of crime, producing and selling crystal methamphetamine with his former student, Jesse (Aaron Paul), in a desire to secure his family’s financial future while avoiding detection from his DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris). Breaking Bad has received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its writing and Cranston’s performance on the show, and has won several Emmy Awards, including three consecutive Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series wins for Bryan Cranston as well as an Outstanding Supporting Actor win for Aaron Paul. 《超越罪恶》讲述了一位普通的高中化学老师在得知自己身患绝症之后，为了给家人留下财产，而利用自己超凡的化学知识制造毒品，并成为世界顶级毒王的传奇犯罪故事。 第一季故事发生在新墨西哥州，高中化学老师沃尔特-怀特是一位平凡得不能再平凡的小人物。沃特本是大学研究所化学高材生，并参与过诺贝尔化学奖的合作，但为了过平凡的生活而放弃成为化学家，在一所高中担任化学老师。但是他却被诊断出患了中晚期肺癌。面对突如其来的不幸，他首先想到的是家人未来的生计问题，因为他家中有一位40多岁怀有身孕的妻子和患有轻度脑瘫的儿子。而他是家里唯一的经济来源。 第二季和图可之间的冲突让沃尔特与杰西明白了毒品行业之中的危险与血腥，而图可的死亡亦让“师徒”二人失去了唯一的出货渠道，霎时间，沃尔特陷入了手中有货却无销路的窘境之中。杰西决定通过自己的朋友们来扩展销售渠道，虽然短时间内收获颇丰，但接踵而至的意外让杰西明白，这并非长远之举。沃尔特和妻子斯凯勒之间的关系开始变得越来越紧张，而沃尔特癌症的好转为两人的感情带来了一丝希望。杰西遇见了名为简的女房东，两人情愫渐生，可是，简曾经也是一位“瘾君子”，和杰西在一起，她的命运又会何去何从。 第三季金钱的紧缺和癌症的侵袭都不再是沃尔特将要面对的难解问题了，家庭的濒临破碎才是让沃尔特感到心痛的真正原因所在。由于妻子斯凯勒坚定的离婚决心，沃尔特从家中搬出，搬入了新的居所，这也为他和大毒枭古斯之间的合作创造了有利的条件。为了替死去的图可报仇，两位冷面杀手找到了汉克，激烈的交锋后，汉克身负重伤。面对着逐渐失控的一切，沃尔特感到了前所未有的危机，尤其是他的新搭档盖尔，沃尔特明白，一旦盖尔掌握了他独创的制毒技术，自己将很快被古斯除掉。 第四季沃尔特和古斯之间的关系开始变得越来越紧张起来，古斯不仅加强了对于沃尔特的监视，还企图控制杰西，希望有朝一日他能够替代沃尔特。一些蛛丝马迹让汉克对古斯逐渐产生了怀疑，这让沃尔特的身份几次濒临暴露。沃尔特发现了古斯对自己的杀意，他想要用积攒下来的存款带着家人远走高飞，哪想到，巨额财产竟被斯凯勒用于自保。沃尔特被逼到了绝境，在他的面前只有唯一的选择，那就是不惜一切代价，先下手为强，除掉古斯。 第五季通过一场精心策划的大爆炸，沃尔特终于除掉了长久以来的威胁古斯塔沃，也将古斯塔沃一手建立的毒品帝国连根拔起。然而，“事业”上的成功并没有为沃尔特带来太多的快乐，因为他和妻子斯凯勒之间的关系再次跌落到了冰点。古斯塔沃死了，但沃尔特的野心并没有消失，他联手杰西与麦克，开始建立属于他的新的帝国。一次偶然中，汉克在沃尔特家中发现了沃尔特就是海森堡的确凿证据，巨大的打击之下，他决心大义灭亲，昔日的连襟，如今沦为对手。与此同时，一股新的势力正在毒品圈内逐渐壮大，他们即将成为汉克最强大的敌人。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"英语 English","slug":"英语-English","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD-English/"}]},{"title":"Credit & Debt 信贷","slug":"2020-11-12-23-46-credit-debt","date":"2020-11-12T15:46:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-21T10:33:11.128Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-46-credit-debt/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-46-credit-debt/","excerpt":"Credit (from Latin credit, “(he&#x2F;she&#x2F;it) believes”) is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date.

Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: Just like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions, so do lenders and borrowers. Lenders usually want to make their money into more money and borrowers usually want to buy something they can’t afford, like a house or car or they want to invest in something like starting a business. Credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want. Borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow, called the principal, plus an additional amount, called interest. When interest rates are high, there is less borrowing because it’s expensive. When interest rates are low, borrowing increases because it’s cheaper. When borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them, credit is created. Any two people can agree to create credit out of thin air! That seems simple enough but credit is tricky because it has different names. As soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt. Debt is both an asset to the lender, and a liability to the borrower. In the future, when the borrower repays the loan, plus interest, the asset and liability disappear and the transaction is settled. So, why is credit so important? Because when a borrower receives credit, he is able to increase his spending. And remember, spending drives the economy. This is because one person’s spending is another person’s income. Think about it, every dollar you spend, someone else earns. and every dollar you earn, someone else has spent. So when you spend more, someone else earns more. When someone’s income rises it makes lenders more willing to lend him money because now he’s more worthy of credit. A creditworthy borrower has two things: the ability to repay and collateral. Having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay. In the event that he can’t repay, he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold. This makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money. So increased income allows increased borrowing which allows increased spending. And since one person’s spending is another person’s income, this leads to more increased borrowing and so on. This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have Cycles. In a transaction, you have to give something in order to get something and how much you get depends on how much you produce over time we learned and that accumulated knowledge raises are living standards we call this productivity growth those who were invented and hard-working raise their productivity and their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy, but that isn’t necessarily true over the short run. Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run. This is because productivity growth doesn’t fluctuate much, so it’s not a big driver of economic swings. Debt is — because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back. Debt swings occur in two big cycles. One takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"B-747 Pilot 驾驶波音747","slug":"2020-11-12-23-20-b-747","date":"2020-11-12T15:20:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T08:48:25.270Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-20-b-747/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-20-b-747/","excerpt":"","text":"The Boeing 747-400 is a wide-body airliner produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, an advanced variant of the initial Boeing 747.

In fact, other goods are often better than money at being intertemporal storesof value, since most monies degrade in value over time through inflation or theoverthrow of governments. Money makes the world go around. Economies rely on the exchange of money for products and services. Economists define money, where it comes from, and what it’s worth. Here are the multifaceted characteristics of money. Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people to obtain what they need to live. Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods before money was created. Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for most people it represents something valuable. Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government. Economists and investors ask this question to determine whether there is inflation or deflation. Money is separated into three categories so that it is more discernible for measurement purposes: M1 – This category of money includes all physical denominations of coins and currency; demand deposits, which are checking accounts and NOW accounts; and travelers’ checks. This category of money is the narrowest of the three, and is essentially the money used to buy things and make payments (see the “active money” section below). M2 – With broader criteria, this category adds all the money found in M1 to all time-related deposits, savings accounts deposits, and non-institutional money market funds. This category represents money that can be readily transferred into cash. M3 – The broadest class of money, M3 combines all money found in the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements, along with other larger liquid assets. The M1 category includes what’s known as active money — the total value of coins and paper currency in circulation. The amount of active money fluctuates seasonally, monthly, weekly, and daily. In the United States, Federal Reserve Banks distribute new currency for the U.S. Treasury Department. Banks lend money out to customers, which becomes active money once it is actively circulated.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"Disinformation 虚假信息","slug":"2020-11-12-16-01-disinformation","date":"2020-11-12T08:01:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-18T08:51:44.826Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/12/2020-11-12-16-01-disinformation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-16-01-disinformation/","excerpt":"by Claire Wardle Too often, we share posts on social media without thinking.
