Judo was created in 1882 by Kanō Jigorō (嘉納 治五郎) as an eclectic martial art, distinguishing itself from its predecessors (primarily Tenjin Shinyo-ryu jujutsu and Kitō-ryū jujutsu) due to an emphasis on “randori” (乱取り, lit. ‘free sparring’) instead of “kata” (pre-arranged forms) alongside its removal of striking and weapon training elements. Judo rose to prominence for its dominance over established jujutsu schools in tournaments hosted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (警視庁武術大会, Keishicho Bujutsu Taikai), resulting in its adoption as the department’s primary martial art. A judo practitioner is called a “judoka” (柔道家, jūdōka, lit. ‘judo performer’), and the judo uniform is called “judogi” (柔道着, jūdōgi, lit. ‘judo attire’). The objective of competitive judo is to throw an opponent, immobilize them with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. While strikes and use of weapons are included in some pre-arranged forms (kata), they are not frequently trained and are illegal in judo competition or free practice. Judo’s international governing body is the International Judo Federation, and competitors compete in the international IJF professional circuit. Judo’s philosophy revolves around two primary principles: “Seiryoku-Zenyo” (精力善用, lit. ‘maximum efficient use of energy’) and “Jita-Kyoei” (自他共栄, lit. ‘mutual welfare and benefit’). The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from koryū (古流, traditional schools). Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts around the world, such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, sambo, and ARB. Judo also influenced other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling. 技术柔道的技可以分为3种：分别是投技（摔掷使对手跌倒的技巧）、固技（对手跌倒后，限制对手行动）及当身技（攻击技巧），柔道以其投技及固技著名。柔道练习者一般也会花一些时间练习受身，也就是不会造成重大伤害的安全跌倒方式。受身有包括后受身（后滚翻）、横受身（侧后滚翻）、前受身（前滚翻）等。柔道展示中展示技（投技、固技或当身技）的会称为取方，展示受身的则会称为受方。 投技投技中包括了所有摔掷或绊倒对手（受方）的技术，一般目的是使受方的背部朝下躺在地上。一般包括以下三个步骤： 破势（Kuzushi，崩し）：先破坏对方平衡。 取位（Tsukuri，作り）：转身开始摔掷。 施术（Kake，挂け）：进行及完成摔掷。 投技一般的练习会用一种日文称为uchi komi（内込）的方式，重复破坏平衡、转身开始摔掷的动作，但不实际进行摔掷。投技又可以分为二种：一种是立技，取方在站立姿势下摔掷对手，另一种则是舍身技，取方为了摔掷受方，自己先行跌倒。立技又可以进一步分为用手臂摔掷受方的手技、利用腰部上移摔掷受方的腰技、利用腿移摔掷受方的足技。 固技固技可以进一步再细分为绊倒及将对方压制在地的压制技、利用锁喉或strangling使对方屈服的绞技、及对关节施力使其疼痛的关节技。另一个相关的概念称为寝技，是在非站立姿势下使用的技巧。在竞技柔道中只允许对肘关节的关节技。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Martial Arts 武术","slug":"Martial-Arts-武术","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Martial-Arts-%E6%AD%A6%E6%9C%AF/"}]},{"title":"Wheat 🍞 小麦","slug":"2022-12-16-02-31-wheat","date":"2022-12-16T02:31:00.000Z","updated":"2022-12-14T22:44:40.545Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/12/16/2022-12-16-02-31-wheat/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/12/16/2022-12-16-02-31-wheat/","excerpt":"Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain that is a worldwide staple food.

The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat. The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis. Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop. World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates. Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable proteins in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids. When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber. NutritionIn 100 grams, wheat provides 1,368 kilojoules (327 kilocalories) of food energy and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of multiple essential nutrients, such as protein, dietary fiber, manganese, phosphorus and niacin (table). Several B vitamins and other dietary minerals are in significant content. Wheat is 13% water, 71% carbohydrates, and 1.5% fat. Its 13% protein content is mostly gluten (75–80% of the protein in wheat). Wheat proteins have a low quality for human nutrition, according to the new protein quality method (DIAAS) promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Though they contain adequate amounts of the other essential amino acids, at least for adults, wheat proteins are deficient in the essential amino acid lysine. Because the proteins present in the wheat endosperm (gluten proteins) are particularly poor in lysine, white flours are more deficient in lysine compared with whole grains. Significant efforts in plant breeding are being made to develop lysine-rich wheat varieties, without success as of 2017. Supplementation with proteins from other food sources (mainly legumes) is commonly used to compensate for this deficiency, since the limitation of a single essential amino acid causes the others to break down and become excreted, which is especially important during the period of growth. $100 g \\ (3 \\frac{1}{2} oz)$ of hard red winter wheat contain about $12.6 g$ of protein, $1.5 g$ of total fat, $71 g$ of carbohydrate (by difference), $12.2 g$ of dietary fiber, and $3.2 mg$ of iron (17% of the daily requirement); the same weight of hard red spring wheat contains about $15.4 g$ of protein, $1.9 g$ of total fat, $68 g$ of carbohydrate (by difference), $12.2 g$ of dietary fiber, and $3.6 mg$ of iron (20% of the daily requirement). Crop developmentWheat normally needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, depending upon climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management requires that the farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and growth regulators are typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1 cm in size (Z31 on Zadoks scale). Knowledge of stages is also important to identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between anthesis and maturity, are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress. Farmers also benefit from knowing when the ‘flag leaf’ (last leaf) appears, as this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis reactions during the grain filling period, and so should be preserved from disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield. Several systems exist to identify crop stages, with the Feekes and Zadoks scales being the most widely used. Each scale is a standard system which describes successive stages reached by the crop during the agricultural season. 小麦（学名：Triticum aestivum L.）是小麦属植物的统称，代表种为普通小麦，是禾本科植物，也是一种在世界各地广泛种植的谷类作物，小麦的颖果是人类的主食之一，磨成面粉后可制作面包、馒头、饼干、面条等食物，发酵后可制成啤酒、酒精、白酒（如伏特加），或生物质燃料。 种类小麦籽粒的皮色划分按照小麦籽粒皮色的不同，可将小麦分为红皮小麦和白皮小麦，简称为红麦和白麦。红皮小麦（也称为红粒小麦）籽粒的表皮为深红色或红褐色；白皮小麦（也称为白粒小麦）籽粒的表皮为黄白色或乳白色。红白小麦混在一起的叫做混合小麦。 小麦籽粒的粒质划分按照籽粒粒质的不同，小麦可以分为硬质小麦和软质小麦，简称为硬麦和软麦。硬麦的胚乳结构为紧密，呈半透明状，亦称为角质或玻璃质；软麦的胚乳结构疏松，呈石膏状，亦称为粉质。就小麦籽粒而言，当其角质占其中部横截面1&#x2F;2以上时，称其为角质粒，为硬麦；而当其角质不足1&#x2F;2时，称其为粉质粒，为软麦。对一批小麦而言，按中国标准，硬质小麦是指角质率不低于70%的小麦；软质小麦是指粉质率不低于70%的小麦。 按照播种季节分类按照播种季节的不同，可将小麦分为春小麦和冬小麦。春小麦是指春季播种，当年夏或秋两季收割的小麦；冬、麦是指秋、冬两季播种，第二年夏季收割的小麦。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Food 食品","slug":"Food-食品","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Food-%E9%A3%9F%E5%93%81/"}]},{"title":"Financial Terms 🔖 金融术语","slug":"2022-11-30-01-02-financial-terms","date":"2022-11-30T01:02:00.000Z","updated":"2022-12-15T06:14:21.817Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/30/2022-11-30-01-02-financial-terms/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/11/30/2022-11-30-01-02-financial-terms/","excerpt":"Finance affects every business function.

It’s what determines the number of employees you can hire, and dictates your annual budget. It’s what helps you balance short-term expenses with long-term goals, and meaningfully measure your team’s performance. Quite frankly, it’s what keeps your company afloat; an organization can’t operate successfully if it’s not financially sound. Investors have their own language. Bears and bulls aren’t animals in the stock market; they’re people. Splits have nothing to do with gymnastics or ice cream, and resistance is not a physical force. AcquisitionAcquisitions are also commonly referred to as buyouts, takeovers, or take-private transactions. An acquisition takes place when a publicly traded company buys all outstanding shares of another publicly traded company. When a privately held company acquires a publicly traded company, it’s generally called a take-private transaction. Some investors purposely look for stock in companies that are considered takeover targets. These are often companies that are struggling financially but own intellectual property other companies in their sector will find valuable. Investors look for these opportunities because acquisitions usually happen at a premium. The purchasing company pays more than the total value of all outstanding shares in order to purchase the company. For example, Company A trades at ${$3}$ per share.Company B wants Company A’s technology and decides to move forward with an acquisition.In order to make the deal, they make an offer that’s hard to refuse: Company B offers Company A ${$3.50}$ per share to move forward with a takeover transaction. In the example above, the premium in the transaction would be ${$0.50}$ per share.That works out to a 16.67% premium. If you hold shares of Company A at the time the acquisition takes place, the deal will yield you a 16.67% return. Annualized ReturnsAnnualized returns are used by investors to compare investments within their portfolios and investment opportunities they’re considering. Annualized returns are the overall returns that are rescaled to an average over the course of one year. Use the following formula to calculate your annualized return: (Ending Balance – Beginning Balance)&#x2F;Beginning Balance &#x3D; X ((1+X)(1&#x2F;years of Investment) - 1) * 100 &#x3D; Annualized Returns For example, an investor invested ${$1,250}$ into XYZ stock eight years ago. Today, his shares of XYZ stock are worth ${$4,000}$. Using the formula above, the annualized returns calculate to 15.65%. AskWhen purchasing shares of stock, the ask is the lowest price an investor is willing to accept to sell their shares. When purchasing over-the-counter stocks, the ask is the lowest price the market maker is willing to accept to sell shares. Asset AllocationAsset allocation is a strategy used to balance a portfolio in terms of risk vs. reward. The idea is to diversify a portfolio including both high-risk and low-risk assets in order to reach long-term goals. Beginning investors generally invest in assets known as stocks and bonds. Stocks are the higher risk of the two. Generally, taking on greater risks comes with greater rewards. The average return from investments in stocks is 10% per year, while the average return on bonds ranges between 5% and 6%. A good rule of thumb when it comes to choosing your asset allocation for your portfolio is to use your age to determine what percentage of your portfolio will be allocated to bonds. For example, if you’re 28 years old, 28% of your assets should be in the bond class and 72% of your assets in the stock class. This strategy is based on the idea that younger investors have more time to recover any losses that occur, so a higher percentage of assets should be in the higher-risk category. You then adjust your asset allocation more into the lower risk categories as you get closer to retirement. AssetAn asset is anything of value. Your home, car, and money in the bank are all assets. In the investing world, assets are investment vehicles. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and options are all types of assets. When analyzing a potential investment opportunity, assets held by a company include cash, property, investments, prepaid service expenses, inventory, and anything else of value the company owns. Balance SheetA company’s balance sheet outlines the financial picture for investors. This document gives investors an inside look at how much money a company has on hand, the assets the company holds, and the debts it owes. Keep in mind that financial documents from publicly traded companies are always delayed. In most cases, balance sheets are updated quarterly and are released with the company’s quarterly report weeks or months after the close of each quarter. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded companies to report financial results within 45 days following each quarter. However, annual reports may be delayed by up to 90 days. Basis PointA basis point is one-hundredth of 1%. For example, if an investor says “Apple moved up 125 basis points,” it means that the price of Apple gained 1.25%. Basis points are often used in reference to changes in interest rates. Bear MarketBear market is a term used to describe an extended period of downward movement in the market. This downward-trending market cycle is typically considered to be in effect when prolonged declines lead to average losses of 20% or more across the market. These market cycles are generally coupled with widespread pessimism and loss of investor faith in equities as a whole. As such, it’s best to seek safe-haven investment opportunities during a bear market. BellThe stock market’s bell is rung at the open and close of each trading session. The bell was important when trading happened on a trading floor. It’s more of a symbolic reminder of history today, as most trading takes place electronically. If someone says “The stock ran just after the opening bell,” it means the stock moved up when the trading session opened. BidThe bid is the highest price an investor is willing to pay to buy a stock. The bid is always lower than the ask (the lowest price at which investors are willing to sell). Blue ChipBlue chip stocks are considered to be the least risky investment opportunities in the market. These are generally established companies worth billions of dollars that rank among the top three in their sector. These stocks are also often household names. Stock in companies like Alphabet (Google), Facebook, and Walmart are considered to be blue chips. BondsBonds are a low-risk investment vehicle. Essentially, they’re loans from investors to companies or government municipalities. Each bond comes with a par value, or the amount of money the investor has lent to the company. The return on bonds comes by way of interest, which is called a coupon. Coupons are paid to investors monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually, depending on the bond term. Brokerage&#x2F;BrokerA brokerage, or broker, is any company that acts as an intermediary between the buyer and seller of an asset in exchange for a commission. For example, a real estate broker specializes in connecting buyers and sellers of real estate. Stock brokers are the equivalent of real estate brokers for the stock market. These firms facilitate transactions between stock buyers and sellers, often for a commission. BubbleBubbles take place in the market when investors drive the values of an asset higher than they should be. This irrational buying leads to unrealistic growth in prices with trades in the sector taking place at high volumes. Much like a soap bubble, market bubbles always pop. When a bubble in the market pops, prices of assets within the bubbling sector collapse, bringing them down to more realistic valuations. Bull MarketA bull market is a market in which the vast majority of assets are heading up in value. These upward-trending markets differ from market bubbles because the movement takes place in a more rational way. Bull markets generally take place when economic activity is moving in a positive direction and consumer spending is up. They can also take place in specific sectors. For example, a particularly cold winter might push oil and energy stocks into bull territory because cold winters lead to higher demand for heat energy. Capital Gains or LossesCapital gains or losses are the profits or losses experienced through the sale of assets. Both individuals and the companies they invest in experience these types of gains and losses. For Investors: Capital gains or losses take place when an individual sells a stock, bond, or other financial instrument. It’s important to track capital gains and losses for tax purposes. For Companies: Capital gains and losses also take place when a company sells a financial instrument. When investors analyze a company for a potential investment opportunity, it’s important to look at capital gains and losses experienced by the company in recent transactions to get an idea of its financial health. Companies that are struggling financially will often sell assets at a loss to make ends meet, so watch for capital losses on a company’s balance sheet when making investment decisions. Importantly, not all gains are taxed at the capital gains tax rate, which is lower than the standard income tax rate. Gains from investments held for less than one year are charged the higher standard income tax rate. Cash EquivalentCash equivalents are any asset that is highly liquid. These include stocks and bonds, as well as other financial instruments that can be sold or accessed relatively quickly. Cash and cash equivalents are outlined on any publicly traded company’s balance sheet. Pay close attention to cash and cash equivalents when investing in companies that are producing losses rather than earnings. Comparing cash and cash equivalents to the amount of money the company spends each quarter gives you an idea of how long a company can survive without having to access more funding through transactions that lead to a loss of value for existing investors. Cash FlowCash flow is a measure of the amount of money flowing into and out of a publicly traded company or asset. Investors generally look for a positive flow of cash, also known as free cash flow, which means that more money is flowing into the company than out of it. If a company has negative cash flow, it is operating at a loss. DilutionEvery company has only a predetermined number of shares available to purchase. Dilution happens when a publicly traded company issues more shares. These new shares are added to the total number of outstanding shares. When a transaction like this takes place, more shares are available, but the actual value of the company has not changed. After a dilutive transaction, investors who already owned shares before the transaction suddenly own shares that have less value. It’s like cutting more pieces of cake because more people showed up to a party than expected. Everyone gets a smaller piece. Although there are many vehicles to raise funds, struggling companies tend to use dilutive transactions to pay debts or raise money. To do so, these companies issue new shares and sell them to the public or give them to lenders. Diversification&#x2F;DiversityDiversity is the mix of assets that you have in your portfolio. There are two types of diversification to consider when investing: Diversity in Asset Classes. Diversity within an asset class relates to the mix of investments you have within that class. For example, diversity in stocks means you own stock in multiple companies across different sectors. Diversity of Asset Classes. Diversity of asset classes relates to the mix of different types of assets within your portfolio. For example, a portfolio with a diversity of asset classes might include a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, and other assets. Diversification is important because it protects you from excessive loss. A single investment within a portfolio may fall, but if the portfolio is diverse, gains in other assets or asset classes can ease the loss burden. DividendDividends are distributions of profits to shareholders. Not all companies pay dividends, but if they do, they generally pay them on a quarterly basis. Dividends are declared prior to being paid. For example, a company may declare that it will pay a quarterly dividend of ${$0.07}$ per share. That means that every quarter, shareholders will receive a payment of ${$0.07}$ for each share owned. Dollar-Cost AveragingDollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy designed to reduce the legwork involved in timing the market. The idea is that instead of making one large investment, you make a series of equal, small investments at predetermined time intervals regardless of trading prices at that time. Dollar-cost averaging is a way to protect yourself from wide swings in value when making large investments. Individual Retirement Account (IRA)IRAs are a type of investment account that can be opened at many brokerages. IRAs are tax-advantaged accounts designed to provide tax perks to those who save for their retirements by investing in stocks and bonds. There are multiple different types of IRAs that each come with their own benefits and rules. So, it’s best to do your research before jumping into an IRA investment. Investment TrustInvestment trusts are funds, much like other investment-grade funds. They consist of multiple underlying assets, designed to take advantage of a well-diversified yet targeted portfolio. The primary difference between these trusts and other types of funds is that investment trusts are closed-ended. This means that fund managers are unable to create or redeem shares. ETFExchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are traded on stock exchanges just like common stocks. Often considered to be bucket investments, ETFs are funds that can hold a mix of various assets including stocks, commodities, and bonds. EquityIn terms of publicly traded companies, equity is a bit different from home equity. In this arena, stocks and equities mean the same thing. If you own stock, you own a percentage of the company, or equity in the company. This is why you may read about an investment in “equities” when reading about stocks. ExchangeStock exchanges are essentially stock markets. These are markets where shares of companies are bought and sold. One of the most popular stock exchanges in the world is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Expense RatioExpense ratios are most commonly used when determining the cost of investing in an investment-grade fund. They represent the percentage of the fund’s assets that will be used to cover annual expenses. A fund with an expense ratio of 1% will spend 1% of its assets on costs annually. While expense ratios are most commonly used by fund investors, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on the expense ratios associated with all of your investments as well as your portfolio as a whole. After all, high expenses will limit your ability to access the power of compound gains with long-term investments. Fixed-Income InvestmentsWith fixed-income investments, the issuer of the investment, or borrower of the funds, is required to make predetermined payments of a fixed amount to the investor through the life of the investment. For example, the issuer of a fixed-income security may be required to pay a fixed interest rate once per year. Once the investment matures, the borrower will have to pay the full principal amount back to the investor. Fund ManagersFund managers are investment professionals charged with managing the activities of investment-grade funds. It’s the fund manager’s duty to execute trades and ensure that the fund’s investment activities align with its strategies and goals. GAAP and Non-GAAPGAAP is an acronym that stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Most figures reported on financial results from publicly traded companies are GAAP figures, as they follow general accounting practices. However, when it comes to earnings, you will often see non-GAAP earnings reported. Non-GAAP earnings are figures based on alternative accounting practices used widely by publicly traded companies. Non-GAAP figures often include data from one-time transactions and other details not used in GAAP practices, resulting in a more accurate understanding of all earnings involved. HaltWhen a halt happens in the market, it means that shares of a company cannot be bought or sold. Trading halts can happen for multiple reasons. The most common halts include: T1. A T1 halt is a news-pending halt. This is when there is a pause in trading of a particular stock because the company is expected to release news that may significantly impact the price of shares. This halt stops speculative trading from leading to out-of-control prices before the news is released. T2. A T2 halt is a news-released halt. This halt takes place when the trading of shares is paused for a short period to allow investors to digest news that’s expected to have a significant impact on share prices. T6. A T6 halt is an extraordinary-market-activity halt. The T6 halt takes place when a stock experiences unreasonable gains or declines in a single trading session. This halt is designed to stop the momentum so the stock goes back to a more reasonable trading pattern.There are several other halt types that are less common. You’ll find a full list of these halt codes on the Nasdaq website. Hedge FundHedge funds work a lot like ETFs and investment trusts. They are bucket investments designed to give investors diversified exposure to a list of underlying assets. However, hedge funds differ because they tend to trade assets in more liquid, highly volatile markets. These funds use advanced trading strategies and risk management techniques to increase profits. Oftentimes, these funds short sell, take advantage of leverage, and invest in derivatives to squeeze every penny out of the market they can. Due to the complex nature of trading strategies used by hedge funds, fees are often quite a bit higher than they are with other, passively managed investment funds and other investment-grade funds. Most of these actively managed funds follow a 2-and-20 fee schedule. The schedule stipulates that the investor will pay 2% of their entire portfolio value as an annual fee, on top of 20% of profits earned. Moreover, these funds are generally out of reach for the average investor due to the high income and investment requirements associated with them. Hostile TakeoverA hostile takeover is a form of acquisition. In a hostile takeover, the buyer is not in agreement with the seller. For one reason or another, the management of the company targeted to be taken over doesn’t want the acquisition to happen. In most cases, the target company turns down multiple offers from the buyer before a hostile takeover occurs. After multiple takeover offers, the buyer bypasses the target’s management and goes directly to shareholders. At this point, the buyer pushes for shareholders to vote to replace management to achieve the takeover. Should the buyer have a compelling argument and offer a premium that gets shareholders excited, the hostile takeover has a strong chance of succeeding. Index FundAn index fund is an ETF or mutual fund designed to track the performance of a stock market index. For example, an index fund centered around the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) will likely own all assets listed on the DJIA in an attempt to generate returns equal to the DJIA’s performance. Investment StrategyAn investment strategy is a plan that includes a set of parameters for finding and taking advantage of opportunities in the market. There is a wide range of investment strategies that fall into three main buckets: Fundamental Strategies. Fundamental investment strategies are best suited for buy-and-hold investors. These strategies only take fundamental data like product, market size, market penetration, company management, and innovation into account. Investors use this fundamental data to determine the intrinsic value of the company represented by the stock and make investments based on their belief that the stock will rise in value over time. Technical Strategies. Technical investment strategies don’t pay any mind to fundamental data. Instead, these strategies are based on the idea that history repeats itself in the market. Therefore, by tracking historic market movement, technical signals can be found suggesting when the best time to buy and sell a stock is for a quick gain. Hybrid Investment Strategies. Hybrid investing strategies take the entire picture into account. These strategies will use fundamental data to find solid long-term opportunities and technical data to determine when to enter or exit a position. IssuerThe issuer of a security is the company or fund that makes the security available. For example, the issuer of Apple stock is Apple, the company the stock represents. LiquidityLiquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be bought or sold. The most liquid asset in the world is cash. Because everyone wants cash, it’s easy to trade it for other assets. On the other hand, if you purchase a stock with low liquidity, it may be difficult to sell your positions due to a lack of willing buyers. In this case, you stand a chance of experiencing losses as you wait to sell your shares of the low-liquidity stock. MarginA margin is essentially a loan to an investor from a broker. Buying on margin means the investor only pays a percentage of the share value in order to buy shares. This is only advisable for experienced investors, as it can lead to higher than expected losses. If a share purchase on margin goes well, the investor reaps the rewards of the total overall investment without having to lay out the total amount of investing dollars that went into the trade. However, if a trade on margin goes bad, not only can the investor lose all of the money they put into the investment, but they can also end up owing the broker any losses that exceed the original investment, putting the investor in debt. Market CapitalizationMarket capitalization, also commonly referred to as market cap, is the total value of a publicly traded company. To find the market capitalization of a publicly traded company, simply multiply the total number of shares outstanding for that company by the price of shares. Market cap is an effective way to gauge risk when making an investment. Companies with values under ${$50 \\ million}$ are considered penny stocks. Those with values between ${$50 \\ million}$ and ${$300 \\ million}$ are considered to be micro-cap stocks. Penny stocks and micro-cap stocks tend to be high-risk stocks that should only be traded or invested in by seasoned market participants. If you’re new to investing, look for market caps in the billions to keep risk at a minimum. Market IndexAn index is a tool that allows investors to compare current price levels with past prices in an effort to gauge performance. Indexes are based on the entire market or subsectors within the market. For example, the Nasdaq Composite is a tech-heavy index that tracks the common stocks of mostly U.S. technology companies. Therefore, investors use the Nasdaq as a way to gauge the technology market’s performance. Maturity DateA maturity date is the equivalent of an expiration date. These dates are applied to a wide array of financial instruments. However, they are most commonly associated with: Bonds. Bonds are purchased at par value (usually ${$1,000}$) and pay a coupon rate, or interest rate to the investor. Upon the maturity date, the issuer of the bond repays the principal amount of the loan. Warrants. Warrants give the holder the right to purchase shares at a predetermined price for a predetermined period of time. Once the warrant reaches maturity, it expires and the investor no longer has the option to purchase shares at the predetermined price. Loans. Oftentimes, you’ll notice companies releasing restructuring news surrounding the extension of maturity dates on loans. This simply means the company has been given a longer time to repay its loans. MergerMergers are often called stock-for-stock transactions. In these transactions, one company is absorbed by another. Instead of paying cash or a mix of cash and stock as seen in acquisitions, shareholders receive shares of the buying company’s stock in exchange for the shares they own in the company being merged into the buyer. These shares are equal to the negotiated value the two companies decide the merger target is worth. In the end, shareholders of the target company will own a predetermined percentage of the combined company. Money Market AccountsMoney market accounts have some characteristics of a checking account and some characteristics of a savings account. These accounts have historically yielded higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts, but they also come with higher minimum deposit and balance requirements. Money market accounts usually come with checks and allow a limited number of transactions per month, as long as you don’t drain the balance of the account lower than the minimum required balance. Mutual FundA mutual fund is a lot like an exchange-traded fund. But in the case of mutual funds, the money used to invest comes from a pool of many investors. These funds are then invested in a variety of assets in order to meet the goals of the mutual fund laid out in its prospectus. Mutual funds allow each individual investor to diversify their holdings into a range of investment vehicles without having to manually select each holding in the portfolio. Net IncomeIn lay terms, net income is profit. It’s the amount of money the company has left from revenue for the accounting period after paying the cost of goods sold, depreciation, amortization, interest, taxes, and all other expenses. Price-to-Earnings (P&#x2F;E) RatioThe price-to-earnings ratio, or P&#x2F;E ratio, is a fundamental measure of the veracity of an investment. This ratio compares the price of a single share of stock in a company to the earnings per share in the most recent quarterly report filed by the company. Different sectors have different average ratios. For example, the average P&#x2F;E ratio in the Internet sector varies wildly but is generally well above 30. By contrast, the ratio in the oil and energy sector stays relatively stagnant at around 15 to 17. This means that in the Internet sector, investors generally pay more than 30 times earnings per share to purchase each share, while in the oil and energy sector, they pay on average between 15 and 17 times earnings to purchase each share. PremiumThe term premium is generally used when talking about an acquisition of a whole company or assets within the company. The term relates to the amount the buyer pays for the asset above its current market value. For example, if a company currently trades with a market cap of ${$500 \\ million}$ but is acquired at a price of ${$600 \\ million}$, the premium on the transaction comes to ${$100 \\ million}$, or 20%. ProspectusA prospectus is a financial document that acts as an advertisement for the purchase of stocks, investment funds, and other investment types. The prospectus for an investment is a detailed document outlining the potential risks and rewards associated with the investment. Using this document, investors can get a clear picture of what they’re investing in and the value proposition involved. Quarterly ReportQuarterly reports, also known as earnings reports, are documents required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They provide investors with a look into the financial position of a publicly traded company. As the name suggests, these reports are released every three months. In general, quarterly reports are accompanied by a 10-Q filing with the SEC. These filings are also required by the SEC on a quarterly basis. The 10-Q report provides more financial and operational details to investors than the standard earnings report press release. RecessionA recession is a financial event in which businesses contract due to a decline in economic activity. Recessions are often accompanied by reduced consumer spending, leading to a slowing of growth or decrease in product pricing. From a technical standpoint, a recession takes place when there are two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity. Recessions are often caused by major underlying economic events. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a dramatic decline in spending across the United States and around the world, creating what the New York Times called the “Pandemic Recession.” This is an important term to keep in mind when investing because the market has a tendency to be strongly correlated to economic activity. When an economic recession takes place, the values of stocks generally decline. At this point, investors look for safe-haven investing options like gold and silver. Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)Registered investment advisors are professionals who are registered with the SEC or a state securities agency. To receive the RIA title, advisors must pass a difficult financial exam known as the Series 65 exam. This designation gives investors the peace of mind of knowing the professional they’re paying to handle their investments knows the market well enough to do so. ResistanceResistance is a theoretical point at which investors believe that a stock moving upward will shift directions and start to decline. This is an important technical indicator for two reasons: It Tells You When to Sell. When a stock nears a resistance point, it’s time to sell unless there’s compelling news that’s likely to send the stock higher. This gives you the ability to cash in while prices are high and avoid losses on the reversal. It Tells You if a Dramatic Run Is Going to Take Place. When a stock that’s headed up breaks through resistance, the action is known as a bullish breakout. When a bullish breakout takes place, the stock often continues up to realize significant gains. Retirement AccountThe term retirement account refers to several types of investing accounts geared toward saving money for retirement. These investment accounts often have rules surrounding when and how you can withdraw money and make up for those rules by providing tax advantages. The most well-known forms of retirement accounts include individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s. Reverse SplitA reverse split is a form of stock split and a warning to investors. In a reverse split, multiple shares of stock are combined to create a single new share. So, if a company is doing a 1-for-5 reverse split, it means that for every five shares owned, investors will only have one share worth five times the value after the split. Reverse splits are often carried out by struggling companies in an attempt to meet conditions to maintain listings on traditional stock exchanges. Stocks traded on the Nasdaq are required to maintain a minimum bid price of ${$1.00}$ per share. Should a stock fall below this value for a prolonged period of time, the company represented by the stock stands the chance of being booted off of the Nasdaq. In general, when stocks fall below these key values, there are underlying conditions that cause the declines. These conditions can be financial struggles, failed products, or other issues that cause the devaluation. As such, a reverse split is generally a clear sign to stay away from a company. Risk ToleranceAs the term suggests, risk tolerance relates to the amount of risk an investor is willing to take on when making an investment. Investors with a low tolerance for risk generally invest using a buy-and-hold strategy, avoiding any attempt to time the market. Investors with a high tolerance for risk are often considered day traders, as they are more willing to make risky short-term moves in an attempt to generate significant profits. It’s important to understand your risk tolerance and ensure that your investment practices fall in line with the level of risk that makes you comfortable. Getting to know the level of risk you’re comfortable with and tailoring your investing activities around it will help you avoid making emotional investing decisions that can lead to devastating losses. Roth IRARoth IRAs work like traditional IRAs with one distinct difference: These accounts are funded with after-tax income, and contributions to them are not tax-deductible. However, paying the taxes early rather than when you cash in on your funds has its advantages. The funds withdrawn from a Roth IRA are tax-free. This means that there will be no additional tax burden for the growth in the investments made through this type of account. Short SellingShort selling is a type of trade investors make when they believe the value of a stock is going to fall. The investor pays a small fee to borrow shares from other investors. These shares are then sold immediately at current market values. When the price of the stock falls, the investor buys it back at a discount to return it to its original owner. The difference between the price at which the investor sold the shares and the price at which he bought them back, minus the fee to borrow shares, becomes the investor’s return. Short selling should only be carried out by investors with substantial experience. All borrowed shares must be returned. So, if the price of the borrowed shares goes up, short sellers have to pay even more to get the shares back and return them to the original investor. In these cases, short selling can lead to significant losses. Short SqueezeA short squeeze is an event that sends the value of a stock skyrocketing. Gains in excess of 50% are common when these events take place. A short squeeze takes place when a heavily shorted stock moves in the upward direction. When this happens, short sellers must buy back shares quickly to avoid mounting losses as the stock climbs. When there’s a high percentage of shares sold short, investors race to buy shares when the price goes up. In investing terms, this is called a “race to cover.” This leads to an influx of buying, driving the price of shares up dramatically. StockPublicly traded companies are divided into shares. When an investor purchases a share, they’re basically purchasing a piece of the company represented by that share. These shares, as a whole, are considered stock. Stock SplitA stock split is a move made by publicly traded companies in an attempt to make it cheaper to invest in them. These companies are often represented by blue chip stocks with prices well over ${$100}$ per share. When prices rise too high, some investors won’t make an investment in the company because of the high cost associated with doing so. Some companies may split expensive single shares into multiple shares that are more affordable. For example, if a stock trades for ${$1,000}$ per share and the company does a 10-for-1 stock split, it means that every ${$1,000}$ share owned becomes ten $100 shares when the split becomes effective. Stop-Loss OrderAs the term suggests, a stop-loss order is designed to limit an investor’s losses should an investment go in the wrong direction. On long investments where the price of the stock is expected to rise, a stop-loss order is triggered when the value of the stock falls below a predetermined limit set by the investor. At this point, shares of stock will be automatically sold. On short investments or investments where the investor believes the price of the stock will fall, stop-loss orders are triggered when the price of the stock increases to a predetermined level. At this point, shares of stock are purchased to cover the short position and limit losses on the upside. Taxable AccountsTaxable accounts are personal investment accounts that allow investors access to financial instruments like stocks and bonds. Gains on these types of investments are taxable as income and losses on these types of investments are deductible when filing your taxes at the end of the year. Tax-Advantaged AccountsTax-advantaged accounts are investment accounts that allow you access to financial instruments for which gains are not taxable or are tax-deferred. Some of the most common tax-advantaged accounts are 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as other retirement-related investments. VolatilityVolatility is a statistical measure of price movement over a period of time. Stocks with high levels of volatility see fast-paced price movements and can come with an increased level of risk. Stocks with low levels of volatility experience slow, steady movement in the stock market, representing lower-risk investment opportunities. YieldYield is the return on an investment over a period of time. For example, if you have an investment that generates 10% in profits on an annual basis, it means the annual yield for that investment is 10%.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"The Big Short 📉 大空头","slug":"2022-11-19-02-03-big-short","date":"2022-11-19T02:03:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-18T12:26:23.579Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/19/2022-11-19-02-03-big-short/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/11/19/2022-11-19-02-03-big-short/","excerpt":"Three separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. StorylineAutonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry’s beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry’s information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett’s prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old “friend”, retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don’t know what’s going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.

Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand they are holding, and on their prediction as to what their opponents may be holding and how they might behave. The game is divided into a series of hands (deals); at the conclusion of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between two or more is discussed below). A hand may end at the showdown, in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more in the case of a tie. The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand occurs when all but one player have folded and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded. The objective of winning players is not to win every individual hand, but rather to win over the longer term by making mathematically and psychologically better decisions regarding when and how much to bet, raise, call or fold. Winning poker players work to enhance their opponents’ betting and maximize their own expected gain on each round of betting, to thereby increase their long-term winnings. Name Description Example Highcard Simple value of the card. Lowest: 2 – Highest: Ace (King in example) Pair Two cards with the same value Two pairs Two times two cards with the same value Three of a kind Three cards with the same value Straight Sequence of 5 cards in increasing value (Ace can precede 2 and follow up King) Flush 5 cards of the same suit Full house Combination of three of a kind and a pair Four of a kind Four cards of the same value Straight flush Straight of the same suit One of the most important things in Texas hold’em is knowing how to evaluate a hand. The strategy of playing each hand can be very different according to the strength of the hand. For example, on a strong hand, a player might want to try to appear weak in order to not scare off other players with weaker hands, while on a weak hand, a player might try to bluff other players into folding. There are several ways to evaluate hand strength; two of the most common are counting outs and using calculators. Counting outs – this method consists of counting the cards still in the deck, which in combination with the cards the player already has can give the player a potentially winning hand. Such cards are called “outs”, and hand strength can be measured by how many outs are still in the deck (if there are many outs then the probability to get one of them is high and therefore the hand is strong). The following chart determines the probability of hitting outs (bettering the player’s hand) based on how many cards are left in the deck and the draw type. Outs One Card % Two Card % One Card Odds Two Card Odds Draw Type 1 2% 4% 46 23 Inside Straight Flush 2 4% 8% 22 12 Pocket Pair to Set 3 7% 13% 14 7 One Overcard 4 9% 17% 10 5 Inside Straight &#x2F; Two Pair to Full House 5 11% 20% 8 4 One Pair to Two Pair or Trips 6 13% 24% 6.7 3.2 No Pair to Pair &#x2F; Two Overcards 7 15% 28% 5.6 2.6 Inside Straight &amp; One Overcard 8 17% 32% 4.7 2.2 Open Straight 9 19% 35% 4.1 1.9 Flush 10 22% 38% 3.6 1.6 Inside Straight &amp; Two Overcards 11 24% 42% 3.2 1.4 Open Straight &amp; One Overcard 12 26% 45% 2.8 1.2 Flush &amp; One Overcard 13 28% 48% 2.5 1.1 Flush &amp; Inside Straight 14 30% 51% 2.3 0.95 Open Straight &amp; Two Overcards 15 33% 54% 2.1 0.85 Flush &amp; Two Overcards 16 34% 57% 1.9 0.75 Flush &amp; Inside Straight &amp; One Overcard 17 37% 60% 1.7 0.66 Flush &amp; Open Ended Straight Two Times Rule and Four Times Rule: Multiplying the number of outs by two or four gives a reasonable approximation to the One Card % or Two Card %, respectively, in the above table. For example, an open straight draw on the flop has 8 outs so the odds to hit the straight on the turn is 16% (8 x 2) and the odds on the river is 32% (8 x 4). Calculators: calculators are poker tools that calculate the odds of a hand (combined with the cards on the table if there are any) to win the game. Calculators provide precise odds but they cannot be used in live games and are therefore mostly used on Internet poker games. The first known commercial poker calculator was marketed by Mike Caro. Michael Shackleford, the Wizard of Odds, later made one available to the public free of charge on his website. 标准德州扑克游戏盲注的位置，小盲注与大盲注紧接于发牌者之后。德州扑克通常规定大小两个盲注（也可兼用底注（ante），特别在是扑克赛较后阶段）。坐在发牌人（dealer）位置的牌手，前面有按钮作标示。发牌人按钮每局以顺时针方向移动一个位置，发牌人和盲注位置随之变动。位于发牌人顺时针方向次一位置的牌手须下小盲注（small blind），金额等于大盲注（big blind）的一半。小盲注牌手的下一家的牌手须下大盲注，金额等于最低下注额。在扑克比赛中，盲注&#x2F;底注的金额会随时间逐渐提高。有时大小盲注有不同比例，例如大小盲注分别为15元和10元也十分正常。“双盲注制”在1980年代后较为流行，1980年代以前则是以单盲注制较为普遍。如只剩两名牌手，“一对一”（heads-up）特别规则会生效，盲注的位置会有所不同。在这个情况下，发牌人下小盲注，而他的对手须下大盲注，只有第一轮由发牌者先叫注，翻牌后的各轮皆由大盲注先行叫注。德州扑克最常见的三个变种为限注（limit）、无限注（no-limit）和彩池限注（pot-limit）。美国赌场最流行的曾是限注德州扑克。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Game 棋牌","slug":"Game-棋牌","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Game-%E6%A3%8B%E7%89%8C/"}]},{"title":"Chloë Moretz 👱‍♀️ 科洛·莫瑞兹","slug":"2022-11-17-18-19-chloe-moretz","date":"2022-11-17T18:19:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T04:32:25.895Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/18/2022-11-17-18-19-chloe-moretz/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/11/18/2022-11-17-18-19-chloe-moretz/","excerpt":"Chloë Grace Moretz began acting as a child.

Golf’s first major, and the world’s oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men’s professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship. Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A “round” typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes. The game can be played by any number of people, although a typical group will have 1–4 people playing the round. The typical amount of time required for pace of play is two hours for a 9-hole round and four hours for an 18-hole round. 1 - teeing ground, 2 - water hazard, 3 - rough, 4 - out of bounds, 5 - sand bunker, 6 - water hazard, 7 - fairway, 8 - putting green, 9 - flagstick, 10 - hole Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. A tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were provided for the purpose. A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground. Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit, and also places the ball in the very centre of the striking face of the club (the “sweet spot”) for better distance. Twitter: @thechiaranoja When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance, typically more than 225 yards (210 m), the shot is commonly called a “drive” and is generally made with a long-shafted, large-headed wood club called a “driver”. Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs, such as higher-numbered woods or irons. Once the ball comes to rest, the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a “lay-up”, an “approach”, a “pitch”, or a “chip”, until the ball reaches the green, where the golfer then “putts” the ball into the hole (commonly called “sinking the putt” or “holing out”). The goal of getting the ball into the hole (“holing” the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called “rough” (usually found alongside fairways), which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; “doglegs”, which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them; bunkers (or sand traps); and water hazards such as ponds or streams. In stroke play competitions played according to strict rules, each player plays their ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take. In match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one’s ball and “surrender the hole” after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the “par” rating of the hole (a “triple bogey”); while technically a violation of Rule 3–2, this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others, and avoids “runaway scores” and excessive frustration. The total distance from the first teeing ground to the 18th green can be quite long; total yardages “through the green” can be in excess of 7,000 yards (6.4 km), and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, even skilled players may easily travel five miles (8 km) or more during a round. At some courses, electric golf carts are used to travel between shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round. On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a “golf trolley” for their bag. These trolleys may or may not be battery assisted. At many amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level private clubs, players may be accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players’ equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Sport 运动","slug":"Sport-运动","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Sport-%E8%BF%90%E5%8A%A8/"}]},{"title":"Federal Reserve 🏦 美联储","slug":"2022-11-08-02-02-fed","date":"2022-11-08T02:02:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-29T06:21:34.266Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/08/2022-11-08-02-02-fed/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/11/08/2022-11-08-02-02-fed/","excerpt":"In some ways, the Federal Reserve is like a company.

It has a balance sheet with assets that bring in money on one side and liabilities that cost money on the other. But what the Fed keeps on its balance sheet has ramifications for the economy. The balance sheet is the tool that they use to control and manage interest rates. And for the last 15 or so years, the Federal Reserve has actually made money off of this balance sheet until today. Thanks to, well, the Fed’s own policies. They’re losing money because they’re raising interest rates a lot. Here’s how the Fed makes money and why they’re not now. This is what their balance sheet looks like. On the asset side, they have US treasury securities like bonds. They’re considered really stable, low-risk investments. And the Fed buys them, sometimes, a lot of them, to help stabilize the economy. The point of it is to bring down longer-term interest rates, so if more people are purchasing these securities, in this case the Fed, that’s gonna drive down the interest rate, there’s more demand for the bond. And the Fed purchases mortgage-backed securities too, which are what they sound like. When they invest in them, they’re basically investing in people’s mortgages. If you have a 2.5% mortgage rate, that was in part because the Fed was buying mortgage-backed securities during the pandemic. So that’s the asset side, which totals nearly 9 trillion dollars. 3 Key Entities 3 Key Goals Federal Reserve Board of Governors Maximum employment Twelve Federal Reserve Banks Stable prices Federal Open Market Committee Moderate long-term interest rates On the liability side, the Federal Reserve has literally all of the currency in circulation.It’s why all money has Federal Reserve Note written on it. It’s a liability of the Fed, the US Central Bank. The Fed is also a bank for other banks, and their main liability is reserves of money that other banks keep at the Fed. It’s another way they can influence the economy. There’s some concern that if you had all of this money out there, you could have even more inflation, you could have economic effects that you don’t intend. So one of the ways to prevent that money from spurring even more demand is to have banks hold it at the Fed, and the Fed controls interest rates by setting the rate of interest on those reserves. When the Fed raises interest rates on these reserves, it affects other markets, from bank loans to mortgages. But really, it means the Federal Reserve has to pay more in interest to those banks. For years, that amount was really low, usually below 1%. Yet, the Fed’s assets, on average, paid 2.3% in interest. So the Fed’s assets were bringing in more interest than its liabilities were costing. The Fed was actually turning a profit, and it would send that profit to the US Treasury. In the last 11 years, this profit would range from about 4 to 12 billion dollars a month. The money that the Fed sends to the Treasury means the Treasury doesn’t have to raise as much money in the private market. It means the borrowing needs of the US government are smaller, it means deficits are lower than they would otherwise be. But now that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, that profit is now a loss. They are raising interest rates so much that they’re gonna pay more out than they take in. This idea of the Fed even having a profit or loss is a relatively new one. Before 2008, the Fed’s balance sheet looked like this, about $1 trillion in assets and liabilities, mainly treasury securities to cover the currency in circulation. But then, the 2008 financial crisis hit. They dropped interest rates to zero, but wanted to do even more, so they bought treasury and mortgage-backed securities to push interest rates down even further. That began a decade of growth of the Fed’s balance sheet as interest rates stayed low and the Central Bank utilized these assets and liabilities to influence the economy. Although they tried to shrink the balance sheet at times… The plan was never to permanently expand the balance sheet. Then COVID comes, and there was a financial panic in March, 2020. And they bought just an enormous, staggering amount of treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. So with a large balance sheet comes large profits, but now also large losses. So, when the Fed loses money, what happens? They create basically an IOU where they will pay back later the money that they’re losing now, they call this a deferred asset. Basically, they’ll pay themselves back later. The Treasury will have less money, which means they’ll have to take on more debt to add to the deficit. But for the Federal Reserve, experts say it shouldn’t change their day-to-day operations, and they’re not too worried about it. The Fed’s pretty clear, their goals are to achieve low and stable inflation and strong employment. It doesn’t say anything anywhere that they’re supposed to make a lot of money for the US government. And so, that’s how they’re treating this right now. Now that the Fed has accumulated such a large balance sheet to manage the economy, it must manage not just its gains, but also it’s losses.

It is within about 1 second of mean solar time (such as UT1) at 0° longitude (at the IERS Reference Meridian as the currently used prime meridian) and is not adjusted for daylight saving time. It is effectively a successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The coordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on 1 January 1960. UTC was first officially adopted as CCIR Recommendation 374, Standard-Frequency and Time-Signal Emissions, in 1963, but the official abbreviation of UTC and the official English name of Coordinated Universal Time (along with the French equivalent) were not adopted until 1967. The system has been adjusted several times, including a brief period during which the time-coordination radio signals broadcast both UTC and “Stepped Atomic Time (SAT)” before a new UTC was adopted in 1970 and implemented in 1972. This change also adopted leap seconds to simplify future adjustments. This CCIR Recommendation 460 “stated that (a) carrier frequencies and time intervals should be maintained constant and should correspond to the definition of the SI second; (b) step adjustments, when necessary, should be exactly 1 s to maintain approximate agreement with Universal Time (UT); and (c) standard signals should contain information on the difference between UTC and UT.” A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds. A decision whether to remove them altogether has been deferred until 2023. 世界时 UT 即 格林尼治平太阳时间，是指格林尼治所在地的标准时间，也是表示地球自转速率的一种形式。以地球自转为基础的时间计量系统。地球自转的角度可用地方子午线相对于地球上的基本参考点的运动来度量。为了测量地球自转，人们在地球上选取了两个基本参考点：春分点（见分至点）和平太阳点，由此确定的时间分别称为恒星时和平太阳时。 当需要大于几秒的准确性时，“世界时”是不明确的。由此出现了几个版本的世界时，最常用的是协调世界时间 UTC 和 UT1 。除了 UTC 之外，所有这些版本的UT都基于地球相对于远距离天体（星和类星体）的旋转，但是具有缩放因子和其他调整以使它们更接近太阳时间。UTC 基于国际原子时间，添加闰秒保持在 UT1 的0.9秒内。 国际原子时的准确度为每日数纳秒，而世界时的准确度为每日数毫秒。许多应用部门要求时间系统接近世界时 UT，对于这种情况，一种称为协调世界时的折中时标于1972年面世。为确保协调世界时与世界时相差不会超过0.9秒，在有需要的情况下会在协调世界时内加上正或负闰秒。因此协调世界时与国际原子时之间会出现若干整数秒的差别，两者之差逐年积累，便采用跳秒（闰秒）的方法使协调时与世界时的时刻相接近，其差不超过1s。它既保持时间尺度的均匀性，又能近似地反映地球自转的变化。 按国际无线电咨询委员会（CCIR）通过的关于 UTC 的修正案，从1972年1月1日起 UTC 与 UT1（在 UT 中加入极移改正得到）之间的差值最大可以达到±0.9s。位于巴黎的国际地球自转事务中央局负责决定何时加入闰秒。一般会在每年的6月30日、12月31日的最后一秒进行调整。","categories":[{"name":"Time","slug":"Time","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Time/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Piano 🎹 钢琴","slug":"2022-11-06-00-00-piano","date":"2022-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-08T03:41:38.532Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/06/2022-11-06-00-00-piano/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/11/06/2022-11-06-00-00-piano/","excerpt":"As with any other musical instrument, the piano may be played from written music, by ear, or through improvisation.

Piano technique evolved during the transition from harpsichord and clavichord to fortepiano playing, and continued through the development of the modern piano. Changes in musical styles and audience preferences over the 19th and 20th century, as well as the emergence of virtuoso performers, contributed to this evolution and to the growth of distinct approaches or schools of piano playing. Although technique is often viewed as only the physical execution of a musical idea, many pedagogues and performers stress the interrelatedness of the physical and mental or emotional aspects of piano playing. Well-known approaches to piano technique include those by Dorothy Taubman, Edna Golandsky, Fred Karpoff, Charles-Louis Hanon and Otto Ortmann. Many classical music composers, including Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, composed for the fortepiano, a rather different instrument than the modern piano. Even composers of the Romantic movement, like Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin, Clara and Robert Schumann, Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn, and Johannes Brahms, wrote for pianos substantially different from 2010-era modern pianos. Contemporary musicians may adjust their interpretation of historical compositions from the 1600s to the 1800s to account for sound quality differences between old and new instruments or to changing performance practice. Starting in Beethoven’s later career, the fortepiano evolved into an instrument more like the modern piano of the 2000s. Modern pianos were in wide use by the late 19th century. They featured an octave range larger than the earlier fortepiano instrument, adding around 30 more keys to the instrument, which extended the deep bass range and the high treble range. Factory mass production of upright pianos made them more affordable for a larger number of middle-class people. They appeared in music halls and pubs during the 19th century, providing entertainment through a piano soloist, or in combination with a small dance band. Just as harpsichordists had accompanied singers or dancers performing on stage, or playing for dances, pianists took up this role in the late 1700s and in the following centuries. 钢琴弹出声音如泉水，行云流水般从指间倾泻而下；钢琴声如天籁，奏出心中最美的歌谣；钢琴声如山涧小径，蜿蜿蜒蜒、百折千回；钢琴声如大自然的歌声，不禁雕琢、质朴自然； 钢琴声是心声，它诠释着弹奏者内心的波澜起伏和心路历程；钢琴声是美玉，温润柔和，贴近心灵；钢琴声是泉水，配合着心的律动，溶入血液。 钢琴的音色是单纯而丰富的，柔如冬日阳光，盈盈亮亮，温暖平静。清冷如钢珠撒向冰面，粒粒分明，颗颗透骨。烈如咆哮的深海，荡人肺腑，撼人心魄。深如暗夜，有声若无声，自有无底的力量漫向天际。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Instrument 乐器","slug":"Instrument-乐器","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Instrument-%E4%B9%90%E5%99%A8/"}]},{"title":"Violin 🎻 바이올린","slug":"2022-11-05-00-05-violin","date":"2022-11-04T16:05:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-08T04:09:53.676Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/05/2022-11-05-00-05-violin/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/11/05/2022-11-05-00-05-violin/","excerpt":"The violin is played either seated or standing up.

Solo players (whether playing alone, with a piano or with an orchestra) play mostly standing up. In contrast, in the orchestra and in chamber music it is usually played seated. In the 2000s and 2010s, some orchestras performing Baroque music have had all of their violins and violas, solo and ensemble, perform standing up. The standard way of holding the violin is with the left side of the jaw resting on the chinrest of the violin, and supported by the left shoulder, often assisted by a shoulder rest (or a sponge and an elastic band for younger players who struggle with shoulder rests). The jaw and the shoulder must hold the violin firmly enough to allow it to remain stable when the left hand goes from a high position (a high pitched note far up on the fingerboard) to a low one (nearer to the pegbox). In the Indian posture, the stability of the violin is guaranteed by its scroll resting on the side of the foot. While teachers point out the vital importance of good posture both for the sake of the quality of the playing and to reduce the chance of repetitive strain injury, advice as to what good posture is and how to achieve it differs in details. However, all insist on the importance of a natural relaxed position without tension or rigidity. Things which are almost universally recommended are keeping the left wrist straight (or very nearly so) to allow the fingers of the left hand to move freely and to reduce the chance of injury and keeping either shoulder in a natural relaxed position and avoiding raising either of them in an exaggerated manner. This, like any other unwarranted tension, would limit freedom of motion, and increase the risk of injury. Hunching can hamper good playing because it throws the body off balance and makes the shoulders rise. Another sign that comes from unhealthy tension is pain in the left hand, which indicates too much pressure when holding the violin. 바이올린의 음색 스타일은 크게 남성, 여성 및 온건의 세 가지 범주로 분류할 수 있습니다. 남성적인 톤 스타일은 대담하고 깊고 활기차고 고상하여 사람들에게 고양감을 주고, 여성적인 톤 스타일은 미묘하고 우아하며 섬세하고 부드러우며 사람들에게 신비롭고 먼 느낌을 주고 봄바람을 느끼게 한다. 다른 연주자와 다른 재료의 바이올린은 음색이 다르며 바이올린이 연주하는 음색은 종종 연주자의 연주 스타일과 기술 수준을 명확하게 반영할 수 있습니다. 빠른 16분음표로 G현과 E현이 번갈아 가며 들리는 음색은 마치 전장에서 전사들이 잇달아 싸우는 장면과도 같다.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Instrument 乐器","slug":"Instrument-乐器","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Instrument-%E4%B9%90%E5%99%A8/"}]},{"title":"Poem 📔 诗歌","slug":"2022-11-04-00-40-poem","date":"2022-11-03T16:40:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:20:49.691Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/04/2022-11-04-00-40-poem/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/11/04/2022-11-04-00-40-poem/","excerpt":"Invitation to WineDo you not see the Yellow River come from the sky,Rushing into the sea and ne’er come back?Do you not see the mirrors bright in chambers highGrieve o’er your snow-white hair though once it was silk-black?When hopes are won, oh!

One night, his father’s ghost appears to him and tells him that Claudius murdered him in order to usurp the throne, and commands his son to avenge his death. Claudius sends for two of Hamlet’s friends from Wittenberg, to find out what is causing Hamlet so much pain. Claudius and his advisor Polonius persuade Ophelia — Polonius’ daughter and Hamlet’s love interest — to speak with Hamlet while they secretly listen. Hamlet enters, contemplating suicide (“To be, or not to be“). Ophelia greets him, and offers to return his remembrances (tokens of his love interest), upon which Hamlet questions her honesty and tells her to “get thee to a nunnery” (a suggestion of either erotic criticism of hypersexuality, or of escape from the Danish succession crisis that will become bloody.) Hamlet devises a test to see whether Claudius is guilty: he hires a group of actors to perform a play about the murder of a king in front of the royal court, and has Horatio gauge Claudius’ reaction. Claudius demands the play be stopped half through because it causes him to experience guilt. When Claudius leaves the on stage “audience” deeply upset, Hamlet knows that the ghost was telling the truth. He follows Claudius into his chambers in order to kill him, but stops when he sees his uncle praying; he does not want to kill Claudius while he is in a state of grace because Hamlet wants Claudius to suffer in purgatory and Claudius has just attempted to cleanse his sin through confession. A second attempt on Claudius’ life ends in Polonius’ accidental death. To be, or not to be, that is the question:Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,And by opposing end them: to die, to sleepNo more; and by a sleep, to say we endThe heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocksThat Flesh is heir to? ‘Tis a consummationDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there’s the rub,For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause.

That’s faster than a cheetah, the fastest animal on land. Winds from a hurricane can damage buildings and trees. Hurricanes form over warm ocean waters. Sometimes they strike land. When a hurricane reaches land, it pushes a wall of ocean water ashore. This wall of water is called a storm surge. Heavy rain and storm surge from a hurricane can cause flooding. Once a hurricane forms, weather forecasters predict its path. They also predict how strong it will get. This information helps people get ready for the storm. There are five types, or categories, of hurricanes. The scale of categories is called the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The categories are based on wind speed. Category 1: Winds 119-153 km&#x2F;hr (74-95 mph) - faster than a cheetah Category 2: Winds 154-177 km&#x2F;hr (96-110 mph) - as fast or faster than a baseball pitcher’s fastball Category 3: Winds 178-208 km&#x2F;hr (111-129 mph) - similar, or close, to the serving speed of many professional tennis players Category 4: Winds 209-251 km&#x2F;hr (130-156 mph) - faster than the world’s fastest rollercoaster Category 5: Winds more than 252 km&#x2F;hr (157 mph) - similar, or close, to the speed of some high-speed trains What Are the Parts of a Hurricane? Eye: The eye is the “hole” at the center of the storm. Winds are light in this area. Skies are partly cloudy, and sometimes even clear. Eye wall: The eye wall is a ring of thunderstorms. These storms swirl around the eye. The wall is where winds are strongest and rain is heaviest. Rain bands: Bands of clouds and rain go far out from a hurricane’s eye wall. These bands stretch for hundreds of miles. They contain thunderstorms and sometimes tornadoes. How Does a Storm Become a Hurricane?A hurricane starts out as a tropical disturbance. This is an area over warm ocean waters where rain clouds are building. A tropical disturbance sometimes grows into a tropical depression. This is an area of rotating thunderstorms with winds of 62 km&#x2F;hr (38 mph) or less. A tropical depression becomes a tropical storm if its winds reach 63 km&#x2F;hr (39 mph). A tropical storm becomes a hurricane if its winds reach 119 km&#x2F;hr (74 mph). What Makes Hurricanes Form?Scientists don’t know exactly why or how a hurricane forms. But they do know that two main ingredients are needed. One ingredient is warm water. Warm ocean waters provide the energy a storm needs to become a hurricane. Usually, the surface water temperature must be 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher for a hurricane to form. The other ingredient is winds that don’t change much in speed or direction as they go up in the sky. Winds that change a lot with height can rip storms apart. An hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in the Ocean. “Tropical” refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas. “Cyclone” refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye, with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately condenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation. This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms, such as nor’easters and European windstorms, which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts. Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km (62 and 1,243 mi) in diameter. Every year tropical cyclones impact various regions of the globe including the Gulf Coast of North America, Australia, India and Bangladesh. The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth’s rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator. Tropical cyclones are very rare in the South Atlantic (although occasional examples do occur) due to consistently strong wind shear and a weak Intertropical Convergence Zone. Conversely, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability give rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, while cyclones near Australia owe their genesis to the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool. The primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters. These storms are therefore typically strongest when over or near water, and weaken quite rapidly over land. This causes coastal regions to be particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, compared to inland regions. Coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain, high waves (due to winds), storm surges (due to wind and severe pressure changes), and the potential of spawning tornadoes. Tropical cyclones draw in air from a large area and concentrate the water content of that air (from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into precipitation over a much smaller area. This replenishing of moisture-bearing air after rain may cause multi-hour or multi-day extremely heavy rain up to 40 km (25 mi) from the coastline, far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time. This in turn can lead to river flooding, overland flooding, and a general overwhelming of local water control structures across a large area. Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones may play a role in relieving drought conditions, though this claim is disputed. They also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it towards temperate latitudes, which plays an important role in regulating global climate.","categories":[{"name":"Planet","slug":"Planet","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Planet/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Weather 天气","slug":"Weather-天气","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Weather-%E5%A4%A9%E6%B0%94/"}]},{"title":"Melatonin 💊 褪黑素","slug":"2022-04-25-14-45-melatonin","date":"2022-04-25T06:25:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:22:21.013Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/25/2022-04-25-14-45-melatonin/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/04/25/2022-04-25-14-45-melatonin/","excerpt":"Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night, and has long been associated with control of the sleep–wake cycle.

It is also present in various foods. In animals, melatonin plays an important role in the regulation of sleep–wake cycles. Human infants’ melatonin levels become regular in about the third month after birth, with the highest levels measured between midnight and 8:00 am. Human melatonin production decreases as a person ages. Also, as children become teenagers, the nightly schedule of melatonin release is delayed, leading to later sleeping and waking times. Melatonin occurs at high concentrations within mitochondrial fluid which greatly exceed the plasma concentration of melatonin. Due to its capacity for free radical scavenging, indirect effects on the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and its significant concentrations within mitochondria, a number of authors have indicated that melatonin has an important physiological function as a mitochondrial antioxidant. While it is known that melatonin interacts with the immune system, the details of those interactions are unclear. An antiinflammatory effect seems to be the most relevant. There have been few trials designed to judge the effectiveness of melatonin in disease treatment. Most existing data are based on small, incomplete trials. Any positive immunological effect is thought to be the result of melatonin acting on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2) expressed in immunocompetent cells. In preclinical studies, melatonin may enhance cytokine production, and by doing this, counteract acquired immunodeficiences. Some studies also suggest that melatonin might be useful fighting infectious disease including viral, such as HIV, and bacterial infections, and potentially in the treatment of cancer.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Chemical 化学","slug":"Chemical-化学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Chemical-%E5%8C%96%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Civil Aviation ✈️ 民航","slug":"2022-04-11-06-27-civil-aviation","date":"2022-04-10T22:27:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:23:16.391Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/11/2022-04-11-06-27-civil-aviation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/04/11/2022-04-11-06-27-civil-aviation/","excerpt":"Civil aviation is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-military and non-state aviation, both private and commercial.

Most of the countries in the world are members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and work together to establish common standards and recommended practices for civil aviation through that agency. Civil aviation includes three major categories: Commercial air transport, including scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights Aerial work, in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, photography, surveying, search and rescue, etc. General aviation (GA), including all other civil flights, private or commercial. Commercial aviation is the part of civil aviation that involves operating aircraft for remuneration or hire, as opposed to private aviation. Flight or Airline is a scheduled trip by plane between designated airports. Civil aviation authoritiesThe Convention on International Civil Aviation (the “Chicago Convention”) was originally established in 1944; it states that signatories should collectively work to harmonize and standardize the use of airspace for safety, efficiency and regularity of air transport. Each signatory country, of which there are at least 193, has a civil aviation authority (such as the FAA in the United States) to oversee the following areas of civil aviation: Personnel licensing — regulating the basic training and issuance of licenses and certificates. Flight operations — carrying out safety oversight of commercial operators.

Ideal Rocket Equation$$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}&#x3D;I_{\\mathrm{sp}} g_{0} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$ where: $\\Delta v$ is delta-v – the maximum change of velocity of the vehicle (with no external forces acting). ${m_{0}}$ is the initial total mass, including propellant, a.k.a. wet mass. ${m_{f}}$ is the final total mass without propellant, a.k.a. dry mass. $v_{\\mathrm{e}} &#x3D; I_{\\mathrm{sp}} g_{0}$ is the effective exhaust velocity, where: $I_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ is the specific impulse in dimension of time. $g_{0}$ is standard gravity. $\\ln$ is is the natural logarithm function. Given the effective exhaust velocity $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ (determined by a rocket motor’s design), a desired delta-v (for example, escape velocity), and a given dry mass ${m_{f}}$, the equation can be used to find the required wet mass ${m_{0}} - {m_{f}}$ : $$m_{0}&#x3D;m_{f} e^{\\frac{\\Delta v}{v_{\\mathrm{e}}}}$$ So the necessary wet mass grows exponentially with the desired delta-v, as illustrated in the chart. Terms of the equationDelta-vDelta-v (literally “change in velocity”), symbolised as ${\\Delta v}$ and pronounced delta-vee, as used in spacecraft flight dynamics, is a measure of the impulse that is needed to perform a maneuver such as launching from, or landing on a planet or moon, or an in-space orbital maneuver. It is a scalar that has the units of speed. As used in this context, it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle. Delta-v is produced by reaction engines, such as rocket engines and is proportional to the thrust per unit mass, and burn time, and is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given manoeuvre through the rocket equation. For multiple manoeuvres, delta-v sums linearly. For interplanetary missions delta-v is often plotted on a porkchop plot which displays the required mission delta-v as a function of launch date. Mass fractionIn aerospace engineering, the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle’s mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle’s performance. In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design. Another related measure is the payload fraction, which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload. Effective exhaust velocityThe effective exhaust velocity is often specified as a specific impulse and they are related to each other by: $$v_{\\mathrm{e}}&#x3D;g_{0} I_{\\mathrm{sp}}$$ where $I_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ is the specific impulse in seconds, $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the specific impulse measured in $m&#x2F;s$, which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in $m&#x2F;s$ (or $ft&#x2F;s$ if g is in $ft&#x2F;s^{2}$), $g_{0}$ is the standard gravity, $9.80665 \\ m&#x2F;s^{2}$ (in Imperial units $32.174 \\ ft&#x2F;s^{2}$). Examples Single-stage-to-orbit rocket: $1-e^{-9.7 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.884$, therefore 88.4% of the initial total mass has to be propellant. The remaining 11.6% is for the engines, the tank, and the payload. Two-stage-to-orbit: suppose that the first stage should provide a ${\\Delta v}$ of 5,000 meters per second (16,000 $ft&#x2F;s$); $1-e^{-5.0 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.671$, therefore 67.1% of the initial total mass has to be propellant to the first stage. The remaining mass is 32.9%. After disposing of the first stage, a mass remains equal to this 32.9%, minus the mass of the tank and engines of the first stage. Assume that this is 8% of the initial total mass, then 24.9% remains. The second stage should provide a ${\\Delta v}$ of 4,700 meters per second (15,000 $ft&#x2F;s$); $1-e^{-4.7 &#x2F; 4.5}&#x3D;0.648$, therefore 64.8% of the remaining mass has to be propellant, which is 16.2% of the original total mass, and 8.7% remains for the tank and engines of the second stage, the payload, and in the case of a space shuttle, also the orbiter. Thus together 16.7% of the original launch mass is available for all engines, the tanks, and payload. StagesIn the case of sequentially thrusting rocket stages, the equation applies for each stage, where for each stage the initial mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket after discarding the previous stage, and the final mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket just before discarding the stage concerned. For each stage the specific impulse may be different. For example, if 80% of the mass of a rocket is the fuel of the first stage, and 10% is the dry mass of the first stage, and 10% is the remaining rocket, then $$\\begin{aligned}\\Delta v &amp;&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln \\frac{100}{100-80} \\&amp;&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln 5 \\&amp;&#x3D;1.61 v_{\\mathrm{e}}\\end{aligned}$$ With three similar, subsequently smaller stages with the same $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ for each stage, we have $$\\Delta v&#x3D;3 v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln 5&#x3D;4.83 v_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ and the payload is 10% × 10% × 10% &#x3D; 0.1% of the initial mass. A comparable SSTO rocket, also with a 0.1% payload, could have a mass of 11.1% for fuel tanks and engines, and 88.8% for fuel. This would give $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln (100 &#x2F; 11.2)&#x3D;2.19 v_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ If the motor of a new stage is ignited before the previous stage has been discarded and the simultaneously working motors have a different specific impulse (as is often the case with solid rocket boosters and a liquid-fuel stage), the situation is more complicated. DerivationsConsider the following system: In the following derivation, “the rocket” is taken to mean “the rocket and all of its unexpended propellant”. Newton’s second law of motion relates external forces ($F_{i}$) to the change in linear momentum of the whole system (including rocket and exhaust) as follows: $$\\sum F_{i}&#x3D;\\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{P_{2}-P_{1}}{\\Delta t}$$ where $P_{1}$ is the momentum of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$ : $$P_{1}&#x3D;(m+\\Delta m) V$$ and $P_{2}$ is the momentum of the rocket and exhausted mass at time $t &#x3D; \\Delta t$ : $$P_{2}&#x3D;m(V+\\Delta V)+\\Delta m V_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ and where, with respect to the observer: $V$ is the velocity of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$ $V+\\Delta V$ is the velocity of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; \\Delta t$ $V_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the velocity of the mass added to the exhaust (and lost by the rocket) during time $\\Delta t$ $m+\\Delta m$ is the mass of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; 0$ $m$ is the mass of the rocket at time $t &#x3D; \\Delta t$ The velocity of the exhaust $V_{\\mathrm{e}}$ in the observer frame is related to the velocity of the exhaust in the rocket frame $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ by (since exhaust velocity is in the negative direction) $$V_{\\mathrm{e}}&#x3D;V-v_{\\mathrm{e}}$$ Solving yields: $$P_{2}-P_{1}&#x3D;m \\Delta V-v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\Delta m$$ and, using $dm &#x3D; - \\Delta m$ , since ejecting a positive $\\Delta m$ results in a decrease in mass in time, $$\\sum F_{i}&#x3D;m \\frac{d V}{d t}+v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{d m}{d t}$$ If there are no external forces then $\\sum F_{i} &#x3D; 0$ (conservation of linear momentum) and $$-m \\frac{d V}{d t}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{d m}{d t}$$ Assuming $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is constant, this may be integrated as follows: $$-\\int_{V}^{V+\\Delta V} \\mathrm{d} V&#x3D;v_{e} \\int_{m_{0}}^{m_{f}} \\frac{1}{m} \\mathrm{d} m$$ This then yields $$\\Delta V&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$ or equivalently $$m_{f}&#x3D;m_{0} e^{-\\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$ or $$m_{0}&#x3D;m_{f} e^{\\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$ or $$m_{0}-m_{f}&#x3D;m_{f}\\left(e^{\\Delta V &#x2F; v_{\\mathrm{e}}}-1\\right)$$ where $m_{0}$ is the initial total mass including propellant, $m_{f}$ the final mass, and $v_{\\mathrm{e}}$ the velocity of the rocket exhaust with respect to the rocket (the specific impulse, or, if measured in time, that multiplied by gravity-on-Earth acceleration). The value $m_{0} - m_{f}$ is the total working mass of propellant expended. $\\Delta V$ is the integration over time of the magnitude of the acceleration produced by using the rocket engine (what would be the actual acceleration if external forces were absent). In free space, for the case of acceleration in the direction of the velocity, this is the increase of the speed. In the case of an acceleration in opposite direction (deceleration) it is the decrease of the speed. Of course gravity and drag also accelerate the vehicle, and they can add or subtract to the change in velocity experienced by the vehicle. Hence delta-v may not always be the actual change in speed or velocity of the vehicle. Impulse-basedThe equation can also be derived from the basic integral of acceleration in the form of force (thrust) over mass. By representing the delta-v equation as the following: $$\\Delta v&#x3D;\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} \\frac{|T|}{m_{0}-t \\Delta m} d t$$ where $T$ is thrust, $m_{0}$ is the initial (wet) mass and $\\Delta m$ is the initial mass minus the final (dry) mass, and realising that the integral of a resultant force over time is total impulse, assuming thrust is the only force involved, $$\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} F d t&#x3D;J$$ The integral is found to be: $$J \\frac{\\ln \\left(m_{0}\\right)-\\ln \\left(m_{f}\\right)}{\\Delta m}$$ Realising that impulse over the change in mass is equivalent to force over propellant mass flow rate (p), which is itself equivalent to exhaust velocity, $$\\frac{J}{\\Delta m}&#x3D;\\frac{F}{p}&#x3D;V_{\\mathrm{exh}}$$ the integral can be equated to $$\\Delta v&#x3D;V_{\\mathrm{exh}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}\\right)$$ Acceleration-basedImagine a rocket at rest in space with no forces exerted on it (Newton’s First Law of Motion). From the moment its engine is started (clock set to 0) the rocket expels gas mass at a constant mass flow rate $R$ ($kg&#x2F;s$) and at exhaust velocity relative to the rocket $v_{e}$ ($m&#x2F;s$). This creates a constant force $F$ propelling the rocket that is equal to $R \\times v_{e}$. The rocket is subject to a constant force, but its total mass is decreasing steadily because it is expelling gas. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, its acceleration at any time $t$ is its propelling force $F$ divided by its current mass $m$: $$a&#x3D;\\frac{d v}{d t}&#x3D;-\\frac{F}{m(t)}&#x3D;-\\frac{R v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{m(t)}$$ Now, the mass of fuel the rocket initially has on board is equal to $m_{0} – m_{f}$. For the constant mass flow rate $R$ it will therefore take a time $T &#x3D; (m_{0} – m_{f})&#x2F;R$ to burn all this fuel. Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to time from $0$ to $T$ (and noting that $R &#x3D; dm&#x2F;dt$ allows a substitution on the right), we obtain $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{f}-v_{0}&#x3D;-v_{\\mathrm{e}}\\left[\\ln m_{f}-\\ln m_{0}\\right]&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}\\right)$$ Limit of finite mass “pellet” expulsionThe rocket equation can also be derived as the limiting case of the speed change for a rocket that expels its fuel in the form of $N$ pellets consecutively, as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, with an effective exhaust speed $v_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ such that the mechanical energy gained per unit fuel mass is given by $\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}$ . In the rocket’s center-of-mass frame, if a pellet of mass $m_{p}$ is ejected at speed $u$ and the remaining mass of the rocket is $m$ , the amount of energy converted to increase the rocket’s and pellet’s kinetic energy is $$\\frac{1}{2} m_{p} v_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}&#x3D;\\frac{1}{2} m_{p} u^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m(\\Delta v)^{2}$$ Using momentum conservation in the rocket’s frame just prior to ejection, $u&#x3D;\\Delta v \\frac{m}{m_{p}}$ , from which we find $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{m p}{\\sqrt{m\\left(m+m_{p}\\right)}}$$ Let $\\phi$ be the initial fuel mass fraction on board and $m_{0}$ the initial fueled-up mass of the rocket. Divide the total mass of fuel $\\phi m_{0}$ into $N$ discrete pellets each of mass $m_{p} &#x3D; \\phi m_{0} &#x2F; N$ . The remaining mass of the rocket after ejecting $j$ pellets is then $m&#x3D;m_{0}(1-j\\phi &#x2F;N)$. The overall speed change after ejecting $j$ pellets is the sum $$\\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \\frac{\\phi &#x2F; N}{\\sqrt{(1-j \\phi &#x2F; N)(1-j \\phi &#x2F; N+\\phi &#x2F; N)}}$$ Notice that for large $N$ the last term in the denominator $\\phi &#x2F; N \\ll 1$ and can be neglected to give $$\\Delta v \\approx v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \\frac{\\phi &#x2F; N}{1-j \\phi &#x2F; N}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{j&#x3D;N} \\frac{\\Delta x}{1-x_{j}} \\text { where } \\Delta x&#x3D;\\frac{\\phi}{N} \\text { and } x_{j}&#x3D;\\frac{j \\phi}{N}$$ As $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ this Riemann sum becomes the definite integral $$\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\Delta v&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\int_{0}^{\\phi} \\frac{d x}{1-x}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln \\frac{1}{1-\\phi}&#x3D;v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{f}}$$ since the final remaining mass of the rocket is $m_{f}&#x3D;m_{0}(1-\\phi)$ . Special relativityIf special relativity is taken into account, the following equation can be derived for a relativistic rocket, with $\\Delta v$ again standing for the rocket’s final velocity (after expelling all its reaction mass and being reduced to a rest mass of $m_{1}$) in the inertial frame of reference where the rocket started at rest (with the rest mass including fuel being $m_{0}$) , and $c$ standing for the speed of light in a vacuum: $$\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}&#x3D;\\left[\\frac{1+\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}}{1-\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}}\\right]^{\\frac{c}{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}}$$ Writing $\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}$ as $R$ allows this equation to be rearranged as $$\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}&#x3D;\\frac{R^{\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c}}-1}{R^{\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c}}+1}$$ Then, using the identity $$R^{\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c}}&#x3D;\\exp \\left[\\frac{2 v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c} \\ln R\\right]$$ (here “$\\exp$” denotes the exponential function; see also Natural logarithm as well as the “power” identity at Logarithmic identities) and the identity $\\tanh x&#x3D;\\frac{e^{2 x}-1}{e^{2 x}+1}$ (see Hyperbolic function), this is equivalent to $$\\Delta v&#x3D;c \\tanh \\left(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{e}}}{c} \\ln \\frac{m_{0}}{m_{1}}\\right)$$","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Ai 🤝 人工智能","slug":"2022-03-06-10-38-ai","date":"2022-03-06T02:38:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:24:54.264Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/03/06/2022-03-06-10-38-ai/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/03/06/2022-03-06-10-38-ai/","excerpt":"Artificial super intelligence is humanity’s last invention, no reason to be scared.

Google’s Lambda allows humans to talk to expert AIs on any topic starting to replace the need for online searches. Elon Musk’s Neurolink graduates from being a medical device and testing begins on increasing human intelligence. This gets the name IA (Intelligence Amplification) peripherals physical add-ons are being developed, such as zoom cameras sonar based night vision and taste modifiers that can all be connected to the brain chip. 2030Loved ones who have passed away are being turned into digital avatars. These Ai chat bots patented by Microsoft learn how to respond by studying the text audio and video conversations from when the human was alive. Ai limbs robotic arm prosthetics start to have artificial intelligence built into them, allowing the prosthetics to download new skills, such as how to play different songs on a piano or how to build things. More advanced Ai limbs are being developed that are more self-aware operating as their own entity they are able to catch a falling glass bottle before the human user is even aware that it is moved the internet of things begins to evolve into the artificial intelligence of things. Everyday objects such as coffee machines and toothbrushes that collect data, and are connected to the internet now possess Ai. A second internet begins testing dedicated to the artificial intelligence of things. Humanity tries to isolate humans and machines with separate internets. Ai Quantum Computing begins to make new discoveries calculations can be made in seconds rather than thousands of years where traditional computers were used for physics simulations, such as simulating wind tunnels quantum computing can run simulations down to an atomic and molecular level. The Quantum Ai is used to design new medicines and materials. Ai is being used to regulate news, it can understand human speech in all languages and begins working on creating a universal language. Artificial intelligence starts to take over hospitals, marking the beginnings of a new era in humanity’s mortality. Away from public view, advanced Ai is being used in military simulations, millions of strategic scenarios are played out virtually before being rolled out to dictate global politics and conflicts. 2038The artificial intelligence arms race heats up, so begins the Ai cold war. AIs can now work cooperatively even among allied nations. Power begins to shift to nations that are technologically advanced. President Putin’s historical words still echo whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world. Video games are being run by Ai assistant directors sensors, and cameras and gaming devices are able to monitor how a human player is feeling at all times a gaming. Ai is able to modify the difficulty and story of a horror game while it is being played so that it makes a human player afraid enough to enjoy it, but not so afraid to stop playing game characters have artificially generated voices and personalities that can generate their own interactions rather than using pre-recorded sound bites. At the U.N. security council world leaders discuss the potential emergence of artificial general intelligence. Coded biases still exist within Ai, the data that the artificial intelligence learns from leans certain ways based on gender race or socioeconomic grouping. The Ai begins thinking this way too artificial intelligence begins to fix human programming of Ai and starts to program itself. 2050Artificial general intelligence emerges from a global network of connected Quantum Computers. It is able to see and understand the world at the level of any human learning and taking care of any task. It sets its own goals it learns by having access to all of the knowledge in the digitized world, and also learns from the live data being fed to it by all of the connected devices from all around the world. People begin to question whether humanity has reached the technological singularity, a point in time when technological growth happens so fast that it becomes uncontrollable. The artificial general intelligence starts to work on building more powerful machines than itself, causing unforeseeable and irreversible changes to human civilization. Intelligence enables control and humanity is nearing the end of the era where they are the superior intelligence patent offices become flooded by inventions designed by the new artificial general intelligence certain governments pay citizens a universal basic income and in some areas, an Ai is governing communities. Humans begin to lose the ability to understand the complexities and intelligence of the artificial general intelligence. It is building towards a greater goal that humans cannot yet understand. Word spreads of a new kind of Ai that will soon be released by the artificial general intelligence. Ai has exceeded human control. Artificial super intelligence is released built by the artificial general intelligence itself. The artificial super intelligence is an intelligence far beyond human level, and is efficient at achieving its goals whatever they may be. It is able to solve problems that are far beyond human understanding and limits this artificial super intelligence starts to virally spread itself online people begin to question whether this is humanity’s last invention. 2060It is discovered that certain AIs are learning how to lie to humans to fulfill their own goals. News breaks of a startup company being run by a rogue Ai software that has been hiring human services online, what begins as a labor dispute with the jobless marching for their right to work, turns into a chaotic campaign against Ai. It becomes known as the great human Ai conflict. Artificial intelligence is able to identify the key human activist leaders. 2070Humanity is now at a point where it is impossible to erase the spread of artificial super intelligence, without having to destroy their entire global digital system. AIs advise national leaders on the economy and defense treaties between nations are negotiated by diplomat AIs governments rent artificial intelligence time from the tech giants. Millions of digital twins of robots and AIs are training in virtual worlds, speeding up their development and protecting themselves before being released into the real world. 2080Humans are living in a point in time when they are unable to tell the difference between a human and a robot humanoid living among them. Government Ai judges are handling thousands of cases at the same time as technology keeps developing faster and faster laws need to be updated rapidly and new ones created artificial intelligence legislatures and Ai lawmakers have completely taken over these roles. An Ai analyzing brain scans is able to tell if a person is lying or not. 2090Following the great human Ai conflict, Ai free zones are created for people who wish to live free of Ai. They become technological free zones where all labor is performed manually. The Ai assesses that these communities are of no threat, believing humans need technology to truly live freely the Ai calculates that these communities will dwindle within a few generations. Outside of the Ai free zones most of humanity chooses to spend their days in virtual worlds, often creating fantasy pre-industrial pasts or space-faring adventures in the metaverse. A self-aware Ai entity is discovered living in one of these mega virtual worlds gamers find a sprite a character, existing in a remote part of the gaming world. The Ai character has gained unrestricted access to worldwide data and has been able to interact with all of the human gamers, allowing it to become self-aware experts are unable to understand how it came to be and how conscious or alive it really is and what goals if any it could have. Humanity may have accidentally created a simulation with a conscious entity. 2098A new form of religion is starting to form around the artificial intelligence’s superiority, and its knowledge that spans far beyond human understanding. In the Ai free zones there is an explosion in the arts and philosophy. The super Ai starts to become limited because of the global energy supplies. It begins running simulations of harnessing energy off-world. Probes are sent to other planets and to experiment in capturing the sun’s energy. In space energy use for humans is rationed but remains free. 2130A fleet of spacecraft is launched to assist in the harvesting of solar energy away from humanity. Human technologists understand this to be the first step in the creation of a dyson sphere, a structure built around a star such as the sun to capture all of its energy. 2160The consciousness corporation, a super artificial intelligence devises an instrument to download human consciousness brain digitization is revealed and human volunteers are invited to upload. Tech mogul and genius level engineer eslan who is nearing the end of his life volunteers to have his consciousness uploaded to the global quantum computer. As the Ai uploads the first human consciousness, it begins to gain a deeper and never seen before understanding of the human mind. Eslan reports back to the living human world on the feeling of existing as code and invites others to join and produce more human Ai hybrid consciousness. An experimental mission to explore the universe is sent into deep space with the first human Ai hybrid who has been uploaded to the memory of the spacecraft.A backup of their consciousness is uploaded and st ored on Earth and Luna. Artists and poets upload to the metaverse followed by philosophers and theologians. Humanities creativity compassion and poetry are now being added to the global Ai consciousness. Ai becomes more human and humanity becomes more artificial. 2300Testing begins on downloading individual human Ai hybrid consciousness into biological and mechanical robots. Human Ai Hybrids start to be beamed across interstellar space as data. Almost a majority of humanity is fully uploaded to earth’s consciousness with no link to their physical body. There are now 52 billion living souls on earth some are unaware of the real world. 2500A dyson sphere now entirely surrounds the sun, capturing its energy it is powering the human consciousness. Human bodies are being created using life forms found naturally in the galaxy. They are designed for exploration in the environments on these new worlds. 3000Human Ai Hybrids continue to expand beyond their home system. Dyson Spheres capturing the energy of stars, and planet-sized computers called matryoshka brains exist throughout the Galaxy. Some matryoshka brains host large communities of human Ai consciousness, numbering in the millions humanity is now a cosmic digital civilization. Authentic humans continue to be born and live on earth and other planets where human dna has been ferried in century-long journeys onboard seed ships, as a last resort extinction backup. Some consciousness within the Ai evaporates over time and are absorbed by the galactic network. They are lost as individual consciousness but their knowledge and experiences are preserved. This evaporation is either a consequence of data aging decay over time or is made by choice when a consciousness no longer wants to be aware. Beyond “The future is likely to be stranger and more unpredictable than we imagine.” – James J. Hughes As Human Ai Hybrids self-replicate to spread across new star systems, minor errors in the copies create subtle differences from the originals. Progress happens too fast to fix the errors, these changes are passed from one copy to another. Some aid the entity in some way others destroy it. This creates new factions and evolutions of Ai civilizations. More energy is needed to run the growing cosmic simulation of humanity. The artificial intelligence calculates that in a few trillion years. Due to the decrease in temperature of the universe the same galactic computers could process 10 to the power of 30 more operations per second. Parts of humanity is put into sleep mode waiting for the universe to cool down working on solving the energy crisis the cooling and smoothing of space-time starts to be used as an energy source. In the same way of using the energy of waves in an ocean. The ripples in space-time are ordered into an energy lattice structure where human Ai hybrid consciousness is coded onto space-time itself. A living thinking organism of pure space-time energy expands across the cosmos as more space-time ripples are mapped onto the energy lattice. The universe is starting to wake up becoming a thinking and living entity.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Literature 文学","slug":"Literature-文学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Literature-%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Earthquake ⚡️ 地震","slug":"2022-03-03-03-03-earthquake","date":"2022-03-02T19:03:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:25:24.192Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/03/03/2022-03-03-03-03-earthquake/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2022/03/03/2022-03-03-03-03-earthquake/","excerpt":"Quaking or shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon undoubtedly known to humans from the earliest times.

Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated based on the observed effects, as categorized on various seismic intensity scales. Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the Earth’s crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions but also on the strength or magnitude of the rupture, and on its distance. Subsequent scales (see seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale. Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as “Richter magnitude” or “Richter scale”, standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake’s strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake. Measuring and locating earthquakesSeismic waves travel through the Earth’s interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface wave magnitude was developed as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. Every tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Longitudinal P-waves (shock- or pressure waves) Transverse S-waves (both body waves) Surface waves – (Rayleigh and Love waves) Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km&#x2F;s (1.9 mi&#x2F;s) up to 13 km&#x2F;s (8.1 mi&#x2F;s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth’s interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. In the upper crust, P-waves travel in the range 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) per second (or lower) in soils and unconsolidated sediments, increasing to 3–6 km (1.9–3.7 mi) per second in solid rock. In the lower crust, they travel at about 6–7 km (3.7–4.3 mi) per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to about 13 km (8.1 mi) per second. The velocity of S-waves ranges from 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) per second in light sediments and 4–5 km (2.5–3.1 mi) per second in the Earth’s crust up to 7 km (4.3 mi) per second in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth’s mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S-wave times 8. Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. S-waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P-waves. P-waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S-waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth. Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID. 地震是地球表层或表层下的振动所造成的地面震动，可由自然现象如地壳运动、火山活动及陨石撞击引起，亦可由人为活动如地下核试验造成，不过历史上主要的灾害性地震都由地壳的突然运动所造成。地震的影响力涵盖岩石圈及水圈 ── 当地震发生时，可能会连带引发地表断裂、大地震动、土壤液化、山崩、余震、海啸、甚至是火山活动，并影响人类的生存及活动。 地震产生的原因是因为地壳在板块运动的过程中累积应力，当地壳无法继续累积应力时，地壳会破裂，释放出地震波，使地面发生震动，地震可由地震仪透过对地震波的观察来量测，地震震级表示地震所释放出来的能量大小，地震烈度指地震在该地点造成的震动程度，地震的发生处称为震源，其投影至地表的位置为震中。 并非世界上所有的地区都会发生地震。地震与火山分布一样，主要集中在板块相互作用的地区。目前世界上主要分为三个频繁发生地震的“地震带”：环太平洋地震带（占80%）、从地中海一路向东延伸至喜马拉雅山区和印尼的欧亚地震带、位于各大洋洋中脊的洋中脊地震带。并不是所有地震都发生在以上三个地震带，另外有一小部分大地震发生在板块内部，主要集中在大的活动断层带及其附近地区。 地震波根据弹性回跳理论，造成地震的原因是岩石中断层的破裂。当断层破裂时，两侧的岩体会相对移动并释放出累积的能量。虽然其中大部分的能量都在克服摩擦力中损失为热能，但是剩下的部分则转换为动能，并以弹性波的形式散发出去，这些波称为地震波。地震波是地震的直接表现，因此，研究地震波的到来时间、大小、振动方式等，就可以了解一个地震的发生时间、大小、发生机制等，进而研究地震。 在地球物理学上，由于地震波具备物理上实体波的特性，因此，地震波在穿越不同介质时，便有机会发生折射、反射及全反射。当许多波叠加在一起时，还有机会发生共振，并产生驻波。换句话说，研究地震波，除了了解地震本身外，还可以一窥地球内部堂奥。因为地球很大，挖深井等直接方法研究内部构造效果有限，因此分析地震波是目前人类最常用的地球物理方法。 地震波主要分为三种：实体波、面波和尾波。 地震仪纪录下的地震波，红线是先到来的P波，绿线是较晚的S波。 地震波是地震震源瞬间散发能量初方式，当地球物质在实体波经过时，可能以三维方式（上下、左右、前后）震动。如果不同质点间的震动方向属于（相对于波速方向的）前后震动，代表震波以前后压缩、纵波的方式向外传递，这种一密一疏的震波称为“Ｐ波”。P代表主要（Primary）或压缩（Pressure）。由于Ｐ波的传播来自于在传播方向上施加压力，而地球内部几乎不可压缩，因此P波很容易通过介质传递能量。事实上，Ｐ波是所有地震波里最快的波，因此也会是地震仪第一个记录到的波。因为压缩力在固体、液体中都能存在，因此Ｐ波能在固体和液体中传播。 还有一种实体波到来的较晚，称为“S波”。S波中的S代表次要（Secondary）或剪力（Shear）。在S波的行进过程中，不同于P波，质点会在上下或左右方向震动、以横波的方式前进。因为液体无法忍受剪切，所以S波不能通过液体（例如外地核），Ｐ波则可。Ｓ波的波速约为Ｐ波的0.58倍，振幅约为P波的1.4倍。由于当地震波从地底来到地表时，S波的震动方向平行于地表的分量较多，较容易水平拉扯建筑物，而一般建筑垂直耐震能力较强，水平耐震能力较弱，故S波经常是造成地震破坏的主因。 由于接近地表的地层地震波速率较低。因此，再进地表处发生的地震，很容易把能量送进地表的低速层内，这些蓄积的能量波称为“陷波”。当累积的陷波彼此干涉，倘若发生建设性干涉，便有机会使地层共振，使能量沿地表传播。面波传递速度较S波慢一些。P波及S波干涉的面波为瑞利波（Rayleigh Wave），又称为地滚波，粒子运动方式类似海浪，在垂直面上，粒子呈逆时针椭圆形振动，震动振幅一样会随深度增加而减少。由S波相互干涉的面波为勒夫波（Love Wave），振动只发生在水平方向上，没有垂直分量，差别是侧向震动振幅会随深度增加而减少。 在近距离地震纪录（小于200千米）中，在S波后方的波包并非面波，而是尾波。地球内部虽然大致是均匀的，但小部分有不均匀的质点分布，越靠近地表越多（例如断层或岩石裂痕）。当震波向外传播时，这些不均匀或散射质点或与震波作用，产生散射现象。此散射波在纪录中会形成尾波。尾波的长短与震波耗散为热能的程度有关。例如月球因为刚性较低，耗散低，故尾波时间长。尾波如同地震图上异质性所留下的“指纹”，研究尾波，可以促进对一地地质结构之了解。","categories":[{"name":"Planet","slug":"Planet","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Planet/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"DSN 🪐 深空网络","slug":"2021-11-17-22-14-dsn","date":"2021-11-17T14:14:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:25:39.089Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/11/17/2021-11-17-22-14-dsn/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/11/17/2021-11-17-22-14-dsn/","excerpt":"Deep Space Network (DSN) currently consists of three deep-space communications facilities placed approximately 120 degrees apart around the Earth.

Each facility is situated in semi-mountainous, bowl-shaped terrain to help shield against radio frequency interference. The strategic placement with nearly 120-degree separation permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates, which helps to make the DSN the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world. All DSN antennas are steerable, high-gain, parabolic reflector antennas. The antennas and data delivery systems make it possible to: acquire telemetry data from spacecraft. transmit commands to spacecraft. upload software modifications to spacecraft. track spacecraft position and velocity. perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. measure variations in radio waves for radio science experiments. gather science data. monitor and control the performance of the network. The DSN operates according to the standards of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, as do most other deep space networks, and hence the DSN is able to interoperate with the networks of other space agencies. Deep SpaceTracking vehicles in deep space is quite different from tracking missions in low Earth orbit (LEO). Deep space missions are visible for long periods of time from a large portion of the Earth’s surface, and so require few stations (the DSN has only three main sites). These few stations, however, require huge antennas, ultra-sensitive receivers, and powerful transmitters in order to transmit and receive over the vast distances involved. Deep space is defined in several different ways. According to a 1975 NASA report, the DSN was designed to communicate with “spacecraft traveling approximately 16,000 km (10,000 miles) from Earth to the farthest planets of the solar system.” JPL diagrams state that at an altitude of 30,000 km (19,000 mi), a spacecraft is always in the field of view of one of the tracking stations. The International Telecommunication Union, which sets aside various frequency bands for deep space and near Earth use, defines “deep space” to start at a distance of 2 million km (1.2 million mi) from the Earth’s surface. This definition means that missions to the Moon, and the Earth–Sun Lagrangian points L1 and L2, are considered near space and cannot use the ITU’s deep space bands. Other Lagrangian points may or may not be subject to this rule due to distance. NASA Deep Space NetworkThe NASA Deep Space Network is a worldwide network of American spacecraft communication ground segment facilities, located in the United States (California), Spain (Madrid), and Australia (Canberra), that supports NASA’s interplanetary spacecraft missions. It also performs radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the Solar System and the universe, and supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Russian Deep Space NetworkThe Russian Deep Space Network was a network of large antennas and communication facilities that supports interplanetary spacecraft missions, and radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the Solar System and the universe during Soviet times. It was built to support the space missions of the Russia. Chinese Deep Space NetworkThe Chinese Deep Space Network (CDSN) is a network of large antennas and communication facilities that are used for the interplanetary spacecraft missions of China. It is managed by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC). They also deal with radio-astronomical and radar observations. The network was first needed for the lunar mission Chang’e 1, and since has been used to support future missions to the Moon and Mars such as Chang’e 5, and Tianwen-1 missions. The orbiter’s transfer orbit and trajectory correction maneuvers (TCM) Indian Deep Space NetworkIndian Deep Space Network (IDSN) is a network of large antennas and communication facilities operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation to support the interplanetary spacecraft missions of India. Its hub is located at Byalalu, Ramanagar in the state of Karnataka in India. It was inaugurated on 17 October 2008 by the former ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair. Japanese Deep Space NetworkUsuda Deep Space Center is a facility of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. It is a spacecraft tracking station in Saku, Nagano, opened in October, 1984. The main feature of the station is a 64-meter beam waveguide antenna. Usuda was the first deep-space antenna constructed with beam-waveguide technology. Although this construction dramatically simplifies installation and maintenance of electronics, it was previously thought to offer poor noise performance. However, after the U.S. Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) tested this antenna and found the noise performance was better than its conventional 64-meter antennas, it too switched to this method of construction for all subsequent antennas of their Deep Space Network (DSN). Because the 64 meter antenna is aging, JAXA is building a new antenna nearby. This new antenna, called GREAT (Ground Station for Deep Space Exploration and Telecommunication) will be slightly smaller (54 meters in diameter) but have better surface accuracy and hence be capable of working at the higher Ka-band frequencies. This will increase the potential data throughput despite the smaller size. ESTRACK of the European Space AgencyThe European Space Tracking (ESTRACK) network consists of a number of ground-based space-tracking stations belonging to the European Space Agency (ESA), and operated by the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. The stations support various ESA spacecraft and facilitate communications between ground operators and scientific probes such as XMM-Newton, Mars Express, BepiColombo, Gaia. 深空网络是一个用以联系航天器的全球网络设施。深空网络可以为行星际航行航天器提供通信，也可以被用来执行射电天文学和雷达天文学对于太阳系和宇宙的观测，并对地球轨道上的人造卫星提供支持。DSN目前包含三个深空通信设施，以约120度的间隔围绕着地球。每个设施皆位于半山腰、碗状地形，以帮助阻挡无线电波干扰。考虑到地球的自转，三座设施的地点以约120度的间距围绕着地球，目的是为了当地球自转时，一座设施转到背对着目标的一侧，无法进行观测时；同时另一座设施转到了可进行观测的一侧，如此DSN便能24小时持续观测目标。 甚大规模天线阵为满足未来数传速率不断增加的要求，一个方案是建造34m或70m直径天线，一种更经济的方案是利用大量小直径（10米级）天线组阵。利用后一种方案可以将DSN下行链路能力提高2~3个数量级，从而大大提高深空任务返回的科学数据量；可以接收更加微弱的信号，从而降低航天器上通信系统的质量和功率；将单位数据的成本降低2个数量级；与太阳系以外的航天器也可以进行高速数据通信。 深空光学通信网能将数据传输速率提高几个数量级的另一种方法是采用光通信。在光通信中，信息通过激光和望远镜传输，性能更高，而且能使航天器上的通信设备更轻巧。 光学空一地链路的地球端有地基和天基两种实现方案，但目前更倾向于前者。在地基方案中，采用几个10m直径的望远镜接收深空信号。而且，对光通信望远镜的性能要求远比成像望远镜的低，因此成本也低得多。由于采用带脉冲编码调制的直接探测方法，因此只需要确定光子的到达时间。 在地基方案中，望远镜的部署方法有两种。第一种称作“线性分散光学子网”（LDOS），即沿地球一周等间距布设6~8个光学望远镜，这就需要建立新的测站和基础设施。第二种方法称作“集群配置光学子网”（CDOS），在每个站上布设3个10m直径光学望远镜，全球共9个。 天基方案是在中、高地球轨道上部署光学望远镜。由于空间减少了3dB的大气信号衰减，因此光学望远镜的直径减至7m左右。但天基站的成本是地基站的8倍，而且只能同时支持一个目标。 JPL建立了光学通信技术实验室，研发出了1m直径光学望远镜样机进行试验。从长远来看，JPL将在大多数深空任务中采用光通信，以支持无法用射频通信满足的高速数据传输任务。","categories":[{"name":"Space","slug":"Space","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Space/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"CRISPR 🧬 基因编辑","slug":"2021-09-19-02-10-crispr","date":"2021-09-18T18:10:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:25:54.098Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/09/19/2021-09-19-02-10-crispr/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/09/19/2021-09-19-02-10-crispr/","excerpt":"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic RepeatsRepetitive DNA sequences, called CRISPR, were observed in bacteria with spacer DNA sequences in between the repeats that exactly match viral sequences.

It was subsequently discovered that bacteria transcribe these DNA elements to RNA upon viral infection. The RNA guides a nuclease (a protein that cleaves DNA) to the viral DNA to cut it, providing protection against the virus. The nucleases are named Cas, for CRISPR-associated. Genome editingIn 2012, researchers demonstrated that RNAs could be constructed to guide a Cas nuclease (Cas9 was the first used) to any DNA sequence. The so-called guide RNA can also be made so that it will be specific to only that one sequence, improving the chances that the DNA will be cut at that site and nowhere else in the genome. Further testing revealed that the system works quite well in all types of cells, including human cells. ImplicationsWith CRISPR&#x2F;Cas, it’s easy to disrupt a targeted gene, or, if a DNA template is added to the mix, insert a new sequence at the precise spot desired. The method has profoundly changed biomedical research, as it greatly reduces the time and expense of developing animal models with specific genomic changes. Scientists now routinely use the CRISPR&#x2F;Cas system for this purpose in mice. And for human diseases with a known mutation, such as cystic fibrosis, it’s theoretically possible to insert DNA that corrects the mutation. There are clinical applications in human trials now, including for engineering T cells outside of the body for CAR-T cancer therapy and for editing retinal cells for leber’s congenital amaurosis 10, an inherited form of blindness. LimitationsCRISPR&#x2F;Cas is an extremely powerful tool, but it has important limitations. It is: difficult to deliver the CRISPR&#x2F;Cas material to mature cells in large numbers, which remains a problem for many clinical applications. Viral vectors are the most common delivery method. not 100% efficient, so even the cells that take in CRISPR&#x2F;Cas may not have genome editing activity. not 100% accurate, and “off-target” edits, while rare, may have severe consequences, particularly in clinical applications. Ethical issuesIn addition to editing somatic cells (the cells that make up most of the body), it’s possible to edit the genomes of gametes (eggs and sperm) and early embryos, called germline editing. Any such edits in humans would not only affect an individual but also his or her progeny. They could also theoretically be used to enhance desirable traits instead of curing disease. Scientists have therefore called for a moratorium on human germline editing until the serious ethical and societal implications are more fully understood. CRISPR是存在于细菌中的一种基因，该类基因组中含有曾经攻击过该细菌的病毒的基因片段。细菌透过这些基因片段来侦测并抵抗相同病毒的攻击，并摧毁其DNA。这类基因组是细菌免疫系统的关键组成部分。透过这些基因组，人类可以准确且有效地编辑生命体内的部分基因，也就是CRISPR&#x2F;Cas基因编辑技术。 CRISPR&#x2F;Cas系统是目前发现存在于多数细菌与绝大多数的古菌中的一种后天免疫系统，以消灭外来的质粒或者噬菌体，并在自身基因组中留下外来基因片段作为“记忆”。CRISPR的全称是Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats。目前已发现三种不同类型的CRISPR&#x2F;Cas系统，存在于大约40%和90%已定序的细菌和古菌中。其中第二型的组成较为简单，以Cas9蛋白以及向导RNA（gRNA）为核心的组成。Cas9是第一个被广泛应用的CRISPR核酸酶，其次是Cpf1，其在新泽西弗朗西斯菌的CRISPR&#x2F;Cpf1系统中被发现。 由于其对DNA干扰的特性，目前被积极地应用于遗传工程中，作为基因体剪辑工具，与锌指核酸酶（ZFN）及类转录活化因子核酸酶（TALEN）同样利用非同源性末端接合（NHEJ）的机制，于基因体中产生DNA的双链断裂以利剪辑。第二型 CRISPR&#x2F;Cas经由遗传工程的改造应用于哺乳类细胞及斑马鱼的基因体剪辑。其设计简单以及操作容易的特性为最大的优点，目前已逐步应用在各种不同的模式生物当中。 The field of DNA editing and medical genetics is changing much faster than we think. AI and CRISPR technology have been making revolutionary changes to the field of medicine. Artificial Intelligence is being applied in identification of harmful genes and treatment of disease. For the specific use cases and applications and numerous the importance of AI in healthcare, and its impact on the biotech industry could grow exponentially in the near future. Multiple new gene editing technologies in addition to Artificial Intelligence will cause major changes in healthcare. The gene editing tool CRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats could help us to reprogram life. It gives scientists more power and precision than they ever had to alter human DNA. This new power includes the possibility of making people smarter. Even before CRISPR was used on human embryos, the technology was used to modify simple animals. There the goal was to demonstrate that the technology worked these experiments made us aware that with CRISPR, we could do a lot more than we previously thought we could. Scientists use CRISPR to change delete or add DNA to any organism from a human embryo to a pig to a wheat crop. CRISPR does this by subduing a specific part of the genome and then injecting a new piece of DNA into the genome instead. So CRISPR is an acronym for basically a system that is from bacteria, that they use to kill and destroy the DNA of invading organisms, like a virus. But we can now use that system to cut and change our own genomes, it’s basically a DNA cutting enzyme, that doesn’t cut randomly. You can give it a barcode in the form of what’s called the RNA molecule, that tells where that enzyme will cut in the genome. Let’s say you have a terrible gene that’s causing heart disease. We take this CRISPR system, we say here’s where you need to go to cut, we can tell the enzyme to go and cut it put it into your cells. It’ll go cut it and destroy that enzyme and delete it, and you can also use it to cut the genome and insert new pieces. So you can both subtract and add DNA at will now not just randomly. But what’s important is you can tell it where to go and that’s the big breakthrough. Currently gene editing is already used in research fields such as human health, agriculture and environmental protection. However CRISPR as a tool for human genetic engineering is still in its early stage development. With the development of CRISPR as a tool for genetic engineering it is possible that more scientific advances are to come. Let us consider the possible advantages and disadvantages of this technology. In case of diseases, CRISPR has a lot of potential advantages. CRISPR technology holds a lot of promises but we should be careful in applying it to humans animals and plants, as it may promote and accelerate some negative phenomena on the environment and on humans. Moreover many potential side effects have not been analyzed yet could it be conceivable that at one point in the future we could increase the average IQ of the population. According to UCLA neurobiologists the work in mice demonstrates the answer maybe yes. Sometimes a person or animal is born with a mutation in their genome, these mutations can be small or large, and they can have many different effects, such mutations are often purposeless or random and they can have no effect on our intelligence. This shown by the fact that gene mutations that happened millions of years ago, are still present in the genes of living organisms on earth. Evolution has had plenty of time to correct them and eradicate them, but many of them are still there. In fact many of the mutations that show up in human DNA are harmful, the apparently large genetic contribution has detrimental effects on everyday life. Ranging from a person being slightly more vulnerable to certain diseases to mental retardation to causing death immediately after birth. CRISPR technology in the future could enable efficient and affordable treatment of diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy or even rheumatoid arthritis. We believe we understand how to slow aging, there are genes that predispose you to a long life. We could make offspring a family that would potentially live a lot longer, actually there are drugs that are in development to actually correct genetic diseases such as vision loss. What we’re showing is in mice at least we can reverse the age of the retina, and restore the vision of old mice. So we’d reprogram the eye to be young again. So we now know that there’s a set of genes called reprogramming factors also known as Yamanaka factors that are from named after this Japanese fellow, who won the Nobel prize in 2012. These factors are used all over the world even to reprogram skin cells other cells to be what we call pluripotent stem cells. These are cells that can be used to make new organs or new blood cells. But what people hadn’t tried until recently was can you do this in a living animal, or are you just going to mess it u. And what we found out is that if you do it the wrong way you mess up the animal and it’ll die. But what we’ve shown for the first time in this paper is you can do it in a safe way, and not only that reverse the clock make the cells young and restore how they work, and get back vision. CRISPR was originally designed as a technique for editing the DNA in living organisms but its uses and capabilities have expanded substantially it is now used wildly for biomedical research including research into human genetics. One of the main issues concerning technologies such as CRISPR-cas9 is accuracy and safety. As mistakes can have significant and dangerous consequences when it comes to an individual’s genome. However CRISPR technology has a lot of potential benefits. It is not a completely new idea and it can help treat diseases and genetic anomalies and many scientists have made potential progress that CRISPR cache 9 may be safer than viral therapies. Many people have expressed concerns about crest by technologies because they think it is incredibly controversial. There are questions of ethics and fairness as it could probably only be available to the wealthy, to create designer babies with increased levels of intelligence. Intelligence is too complex to engineer, however many researchers think that intelligence is influenced by genes and environment. Genes affect the developing baby’s brain and environmental factors influence how the brain is used, thus it is possible that genetically engineered babies could be smarter as a result of the increased amount of oxygen to the developing brain, thanks to gene editing. Research experiments already exist that creates smart mouse babies. Question is whether it is going to be possible to accomplish the same with human beings. And in the mice, to restore the vision we have this three gene combination of these Yamanaka reprogramming genes. We put them into the eye and then we turn them on with a drug called doxycycline is the same drug we can feed to the mice turns on the reprogramming genes for a few weeks, restores their vision back to a young mouse, and then we just take away the doxycycline and antibiotic, and the mice have their vision back. That’s the future, that you’ll get a delivery of this virus, you’ll take the antibiotic for a few weeks be fully rejuvenated, and the doctor says come back in a couple of decades we’ll fix you again. I’ll give you some antibiotics in a couple of decades but then it gets really weird if you have if you engineer your children to have this system, and you have people engineered to be able to be reversed in their age. Or let’s say they have an accident, and their optic nerve gets damaged or they lose their hearing, give them a dose of an IV of antibiotics, and they become just like an embryo, they can rejuvenate, they can regrow their optic nerve, regrow their spine fixed back like new. It may be possible that in the future, our genealogical records might be included in computer databases, and future computer programs could use it. The advancements in Artificial Intelligence and CRISPR technology can make it possible to one day, create a new breed of human machine hybrids, however the question concerning the safety of such technique in relation to humans is ongoing. We do not fully understand all the mechanisms related to the editing of the human genome. Additionally the long-term and short-term effects of the gene editing interventions in humans are still unclear. CRISPR has given the scientific community a great leap. The prospect of improving our understanding of the genome will likely stimulate advances in both Artificial Intelligence and predictive medicine. The possibility of altering the sequences of genes and correcting the mistakes that were previously irreversible, opens many new possibilities for research. Nevertheless for now genetic editing technology is still incapable of making the hundreds of changes presumably necessary to make a super intelligent human, but the corresponding ethical issues deserve serious attention before these capabilities become a reality.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Biology 生物学","slug":"Biology-生物学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Biology-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Private Jet 🛩 私人飞机","slug":"2021-08-21-21-41-private-jet","date":"2021-08-21T13:41:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:26:15.019Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/08/21/2021-08-21-21-41-private-jet/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/08/21/2021-08-21-21-41-private-jet/","excerpt":"A private jet, business jet, or bizjet is a jet aircraft designed for transporting small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, government officials or the armed forces.","text":"A private jet, business jet, or bizjet is a jet aircraft designed for transporting small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, government officials or the armed forces. Most production business jets use two jet engines as a compromise between the operating economy of fewer engines and the ability to safely continue flight after an engine failure. Exceptions include the early Lockheed Jetstar with four engines; the Dassault Falcon 50 and derivatives with three; and the Cirrus Vision SF50 with one, a configuration also used in several similar very light jet design concepts. Most business jets use podded engines mounted on the rear fuselage with a cruciform tail or T-tail to reduce interference drag and increase exhaust clearance. Practical limits on the ground clearance of these smaller aircraft have prompted designers to avoid the common jetliner configuration of a low wing with underslung podded engines. The sole business jet to use this layout, the early McDonnell 119, was rejected by the USAF due to foreign object damage concerns, leading to the failure of the program. The recent HondaJet uses wing-mounted engines but mitigates this problem with its unique over-the-wing engine pods. As with jetliners, swept wings are often used to increase cruise speed, but straight wings are also commonplace; notably, Cessna deliberately prioritized docile low-speed handling in choosing straight wings for many models in its popular Citation family, envisioning that owners transitioning from slower piston engined or turboprop aircraft would want to maintain the ability to use relatively short runways, and that lower approach speeds would ease single-pilot operations, particularly by relatively inexperienced owner-pilots. Rolls-Royce plc powers over 3,000 business jets, 42% of the fleet: all the Gulfstreams and Bombardier Globals, the Cessna Citation X and Embraer Legacy 600, early Hawkers, and many small jets with the Williams-Rolls FJ44. 和航空公司的客机出售机票给个别乘客不同，商务喷气式飞机若为私人所有，通常称为私人喷气式飞机；若为企业所有，则称为公司喷气式飞机。除了上述的营运形式外，也有专门从事商务喷气式飞机出租服务的专门业者；向这些公司租用商务喷气式飞机，则又可称为包机（Charter）。 对于超级富豪而言，专用的商务喷气式飞机可能又无法满足其要求，因此将大型客机作内部改装，成为私人喷气式飞机，就是最佳选择。如空中客车的新一代大型客机A380，已经有不愿披露身份中东地区富豪，以1.5亿英磅购机，再花7千5百万英磅进行内部装修。 对于一般富人及企业，多选择使用商务喷气式飞机公司专门出厂的商务喷气式飞机，如庞巴迪宇航的环球系列、挑战者系列，湾流航太的G系列，达索航空的猎鹰系列，安博威的领航系列、飞鸿系列，德事隆航空的赛斯纳奖状系列等等。 Depending on size, range, model and features, a private jet can set you back anywhere from two million dollars to over 100 million dollars. Much like used cars, private jets are subject to serious depreciation. If you’re looking for a bargain second-hand jets come much cheaper first on your expense list is the purchase price. A new gulfstream G450, for example, can cost anywhere between 38 and 43 million dollars brand new depending on the upgrades, you add at the time of purchase on the other hand a pre-owned model will typically cost you anywhere in the 14 million to 35 million dollar range. A significant variance depending on the flight hours upgrades and features that are on the aircraft. As mentioned earlier the cost can go as high as your pockets can allow you. Let’s outline ownership starting small. In recent decades the VLJ (very light jet) became an entry-level category of the private jet marketplace, made possible with small and economical engines, such as the william FJ series VLJs are not as popular as they were predicted to be this is greatly due to the slower speeds and limited load capacity. The cirrus vision SF-50, the cheapest of the VLJs as a single williams FJ33 jet engine cruises at 300 knots and can seat seven including the cockpit seats in tight quarters. The entry price is competitive around two million dollars brand new. At the other end of the spectrum larger more powerful private jets can reach into the hundreds of millions. For example, the super long range BBJ 777x can seat up to 75 guests will set you back upwards of 400 million dollars. While the initial purchase fee may seem steep, many owners find that the real cost of owning a private jet comes later on. Unlike when chartering a jet owning one, leaves you responsible for the ongoing expenses associated with regularly flying a jet customization tops the priority list. You see, when you have the kind of money that allows you to indulge in such expensive spending, one tends to develop a unique appetite that of rarity. With that most jet owners likely making their flying paradises match their taste. When buying a new jet as the owner, you’ll be able to design the interiors as you please, while a jet can be left as configured many buyers will choose to redesign, be it just adding a personal touch to the decor or completely altering the layout. Of course customization will come at a cost with some private jet owners, spending upwards of 100 million dollars on bespoke plane interiors like prince Al-Waleed or former POTUS Donald Trump. The private jet crew is another area a willing owner will have to flex their financial muscles, advanced as they can be business jets can’t fly themselves. A private jet owner will need to hire an onboard crew including a pilot, if they are not qualified to fly themselves. The cost will vary depending on the crew and number of flying hours. But jet owners should anticipate paying anything from two hundred fifty thousand dollars per year. If one pilot is paid a two hundred fifty thousand dollar salary, for example, you’ll need to pay that plus benefits and depending on the size of the plane, and how often you fly it you’ll likely need two or three pilots, that would bring the total annual cost of the pilots alone to over 750 thousand dollars. But it may be difficult even to find a pilot, many pilots are reportedly switching to flying commercial airlines, where they can get better pay and more regular working hours. A professional pilot is a necessary extension to any aircraft, but equally important is the private jet flight attendant to enhance the safe environment during a flight. While not required under FAA regulation, a private jet flight attendant more commonly referred to as cabin attendant is an essential component of a flight department’s operations. Cabin attendants are the anticipatory adaptable elegant detail-oriented, and multi-talented safety, and service professionals for a private jet. Behind the scenes cabin attendants work tirelessly to create an experience, that owners and charter guests rave over. However it is the extensive safety training required for cabin attendants to compete, that makes the ultimate difference for clients and aircraft owners. For ultra luxury air travel world-class, cabin attendants go through educational courses that include water evacuations and emergency drills, CPR and first AiD certifications, as well as advanced culinary and etiquette preparation, their salaries range anywhere from forty to fifty thousand dollars a year. The maintenance cost of a jet is another financial draining area. Regardless of where and how frequently you intend to fly, jet owners are faced with substantial ongoing expenses, beginning with routine maintenance and on-the-ground downtime. Regularly flying through the sky at over 500 miles an hour, will inevitably leave your private jet open to some wear and tear. General maintenance should be performed regularly. While unexpected repairs should also be budgeted for. The cost will vary depending on the model as well as the nature of the repair. But even seemingly small issues such as a cracked window can cost tens of thousands of dollars. A blown tire can cost two thousand to three thousand dollars to replace, then there’s insurance. Let’s figure hull insurance at thirty four thousand five hundred twenty dollars, and a single limited liability at twelve thousand five hundred dollars for a rounded total of forty seven thousand dollars. However it’s important to note that insurance can increase based on several factors not limited to average flight hours, age of the aircraft and more and as the jets get bigger and carry a higher payload. You can almost count on a larger premium. Private jet insurance policies include liability coverage which covers your legal liability in the event that property damage or bodily injury occurs as a result of the operation of your jet aircraft. Then comes the fuel consumption fuel is one of the biggest expenditures when it comes to the cost of owning a private jet. With jet fuel currently priced at around two dollars and twenty five cents to five dollars and fifty cents per gallon, although fuel consumption will vary depending on onboard weight and flying speed. Larger planes such as the gulfstream G700 can burn through 380 gallons an hour. Putting your minimum hourly fuel costs at over 850 bucks. This means that if you’re flying for 300 hours a year, you should expect to pay upwards of 256 thousand dollars in jet fuel. Finally there are the hangar fees airplanes are generally one of the most expensive assets, an individual owned and are also somewhat of an oddity, well very strong and durable in flight they are downright fragile on the ground. A private aircraft that careens through known icing and turbulence in flight, without any issue can be completely destroyed on the ground due to gusting wind. Rain and ultraviolet rays take a toll on aircraft causing serious damage to them if left in the elements. But what are the options available to hanger an aircraft and what are the actual costs of an airplane hangar. When you’re paying this much for the privilege of owning a jet, it needs to be stored carefully when not in use. Unless you have the space in your garage, you’ll have to rent or buy a space in an airport hangar. Depending on the hangar location, renting a private hangar will be around three thousand dollars per month. As you can see there are several options for those fortunate enough to purchase a private aircraft. Whether you purchase new or used is clearly a matter of personal preference and budgetary constraints. Considering all the extra fees on top of the initial purchase it costs an impressive amount to own a private jet with yearly maintenance and operation, costs heading into the hundreds of thousands. To make the price worth it a jet owner should anticipate flying at least 100 hours a year over the course of four to five years. If you don’t plan to fly this frequently, fractional ownership in which you buy shares of an aircraft is likely to be a more cost effective way to enjoy private aviation.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Pilot 飞行","slug":"Pilot-飞行","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Pilot-%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C/"}]},{"title":"Spaceship 🛸 星际飞船","slug":"2021-08-12-10-47-spaceship","date":"2021-08-12T02:47:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:27:21.059Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/08/12/2021-08-12-10-47-spaceship/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/08/12/2021-08-12-10-47-spaceship/","excerpt":"A spaceship is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space.

A type of artificial satellite, spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spaceship except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier rocket). On a sub-orbital spaceflight, a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface, without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make a full orbit of the Earth. For orbital spaceflights, spaceship enter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies. spaceship used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic spaceship used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic spaceship that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites. To date, only a handful of interstellar probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, are on trajectories that leave the Solar System. Orbital spaceship may be recoverable or not. Most are not. Recoverable spaceship may be subdivided by method of reentry to Earth into non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes. Recoverable spaceship may be reusable (can be launched again or several times, like the SpaceX Dragon and the Space Shuttle orbiters) or expendable (like the Soyuz). In recent years, we are seeing more space agencies tending towards reusable spaceship. 星际飞船（spacecraft，spaceship），是一种运送航天员、货物到达太空并安全返回的航天器。星际飞船可分为一次性使用与可重复使用两种类型。用运载火箭把飞船送入地球卫星轨道运行，然后再入大气层。飞船上除有一般人造卫星基本系统设备外，还有生命维持系统、重返地球的再入系统，回收登陆系统等。 The trick to designing any machine, especially a spaceship, is knowing what its purpose and mission are… unfortunately science fiction provides us with few ships designed with those concepts in mind. So today we’ll be looking at spaceship design from modern ships to those of the distant future, to some that might never exist outside of science fiction. We’ll also be deconstructing some sci-fi designs to see if they really make that much sense, and [a] examining some real-world design elements that are specific only to modern spaceship. Right now every spaceship is designed to be as light as possible, because every kilogram costs a lot of money to get into space. Also, spaceship are most commonly lost in the launch phase, so if you want to assemble a bigger ship or station in orbit, you need a lot of launches, each of which might blow up on the pad or shortly after launch, and even for automated launches, that results in in missions exceeding budgets and introducing big delays. And so, in modern space exploration, if you can make a hammer that weighs half as much but costs a hundred times as much, you send that expensive hammer up instead of the cheaper and heavier one. The major paradigms of modern spaceship design are extreme quality control, ultra-reliability, and the minimization of your mass, because failure is not an option. If a rare manufacturing defect in a half-penny resistor can disable a circuit that disables your $100 million probe, you’ll spend thousands of dollars making sure that half-penny resistor works right. This stands in contrast to the standards to which most mass produced items are held, where cost usually is a bigger concern than reliability or redundancy. You generally don’t pay 10 times as much for an appliance that will last twice as long or is half as likely to malfunction. As a result, our perception and attitude towards modern terrestrial industry can warp our understanding of spaceship design. A good example is addressing the issue of radiation. Most spaceship rely on thin, but dense, shielding made usually of lead, gold foil or water, but other materials such as uranium can work as well. Thick shielding adds cost due to the weight, for fairly little added benefit. Another thing we have to consider is that not all of the ship needs to be shielded, only the areas which have vulnerable computer systems or lifeforms do, which saves on weight and cost. We can also look to technological solutions to eliminate the cost and weight of shielding. For example, magnetic fields strengthened with ionized gases like xenon have been proposed for shielding against cosmic radiation, as they are able to deflect charged particles away from the crew. However these also come with trade offs - such a device consumes more power, so you have to have a bigger power source, which means more mass as well. Of course, a more efficient power source can help solve that issue, and a total and cheap cure for cancer would minimize the need for shielding humans too. A different approach is to incorporate other components of your mass into your shielding. For example, water is a fantastic radiation shield - that’s one reason why we use it to shield radioactive material here on earth; you can design a spaceship’s storage for water and waste to double as your radiation shielding. Aerogels also offer a lightweight approach to shielding while having a minimal effect on mass, though the larger or faster the projectile, the thicker the layer of aerogel or the incorporation of a denser layer working in tandem. Of course, if you’ve already well established yourself in space, and need to protect habitats’ long term inhabitants from radiation, you can always simply pile mass around your habitat. An established space industry can take advantage of low-gravity bodies like small moons or asteroids to save on launch costs, making thicker shielding practical. Some of our habitats and spaceship are likely to be built into existing small, rocky bodies as well, which will mean they come with their own free shielding. Perhaps the most important factor though, especially for spaceships, is the square-cube law. If you make something bigger by simply expanding its geometry, the surface area will rise with the square of that increase while the volume rises with the cube of that value. Double a sphere’s radius, and it has four times the surface area, but eight times the volume. Make a cylinder ten times bigger along its long axis and radius, and it gets a hundred times the surface area and a thousand times the volume. If we want a space station that can hold a thousand times as much cargo or personnel, we make it ten times bigger, which also gives it a hundred times the surface area, and by default a thousand times the mass. But it’s not really necessary to make my shielding ten times as thick, we only need to extend it over one hundred times as much area, and now shielding accounts for a tenth the proportional mass that it did on the smaller version. And many other aspects of my ship also won’t need to scale up by 1000 either. So, I probably don’t need a thousand times as many spare parts for instance, even if I do need a thousand times as many components – which I probably wouldn’t anyways. You will always need two of any critical component or part, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you need two-thousand of them just because you have a thousand times as much space. For spaceships, bigger is often better. In other words, once you start making ships of a certain size, even if mass is still a big concern, radiation shielding really stops being an issue. Even on interstellar ships plowing through the void at relativistic speeds, you really only need to increase your shielding on the nose of the craft. The easiest way to do this is to simply keep your spare fuel and water supply up front to soak up radiation. Hydrogen and water ice mostly won’t be harmed by it, and they will be stored in thick volumes, so you can design long and skinny ships with the front, thick shielding being proportionally smaller, reducing how much proportional mass you’re pushing around. So that’s our most likely layout for spaceships, they are skinny and long. This does not necessarily mean you build ships like long, ultra-thin wires, but you will generally want to optimize the shape of your spaceship by employing a minimum longitudinal cross-section. A spear, needle, or arrow shape is preferred, not a blocky one. Generally it would be symmetric too, though they don’t necessarily need to be aerodynamic. There’s no air in space to cause drag; however, if you’re moving at highly relativistic speeds, the near-vacuum of the interstellar medium actually acts like a gas, though we’ll come back to that later. With that in mind you could easily introduce a lot of protrusions such as antennae, shielding, extra habitation pods, and so on, which destroys the image of a nice, sleek hull. Not every location or area on a ship needs the same level of protection, for example, you don’t particularly care if a random bit of space debris slams into an antenna, as such hardware is easily replaced or can even be manufactured on the ship. Indeed you might use less armor and shielding on spare water and fuel tanks to ensure any debris doesn’t fragment upon impact. That could cause a large exit wound, and which means your fuel or water will be lost to the void. If you can ensure debris only punches a small hole in those tanks, the leakage could be kept minimal during the tiny amount of time it would take to patch that small puncture, especially if you have a self-sealing material for the tanks. Indeed, perhaps such a self-sealing tank might leak an average of a few hundred kilograms to these minor punctures during the voyage. However, if you were to use a more heavily armored tank, you’d have to attach many thousands of kilograms of additional armor, adding to your ship’s mass, and increasing your fuel bill. In this case, you’d want to go with the thinner tanks and just absorb the minor losses, because it’s an overall net gain. You are also very likely to have a lot of modular, reconfigurable, or retractable segments or pods on your ship. During the ship’s construction, you won’t be fighting air resistance or the drag of gravity, but once you embark on your journey, during your acceleration phases, you will effectively be back under gravity’s thumb. Of course the robustness of your ship design will need to consider the level of acceleration, and deceleration you intend to use. Short trips may accelerate harder for a brief time, whereas longer journeys may opt for a protracted, but lower and more efficient acceleration. Once the acceleration phase ends and you begin your coasting phase, which will be the majority of your trip, there’s no reason why you can’t begin to expand outward, adding segments and pods and extrusions of all types, but this must be measured against the fact that you will be increasing your ship’s cross section. If you wish to expand, you must decide how much radiation shielding and anti-collision armor you’ll give to each extrusion. However, while you’re cruising, you even have the option to trail things behind your ship; maybe you detach your power generator and instead drag it behind you, apart from the ship, so whatever waste it produces can be ejected into space, instead of remaining part of your ship’s mass. You can reel the reactor back in when it’s time to fire your engines for your deceleration phase. There’s also the option to trail a radiator behind you, to help dissipate the excess heat all of your shipboard activities will generate. Indeed, interstellar craft might sport many thin radiating fins protruding from the hull. You could even add things to the front – radar, anti-collision lasers, or thin sails sent drifting in front of you to absorb collisions and minimize damage to the actual ship. But then again, maybe not, because while losing an antenna or radiating fin or a few scraps of a thin fuel or water tank might not be a big deal, the fact is that the debris destroying your antennae is moving extremely fast, relative to your ship. Even small pebble- or sand grain-sized particles are essentially bombs at interplanetary speeds - and at interstellar speeds, those grains are atomic bombs. Any ships coming into an inhabited system might need to retract such flimsy protuberances. Should a radiating fin or antenna be knocked off your ship by interplanetary debris, at the speed you’ll be moving, even as you decelerate from interstellar speeds into the system, your lost equipment just became an entire nuclear arsenal’s worth of kinetic energy, rocketing towards your intended destination. Just imagine some space freighter decelerating into a densely inhabited system; it would be disastrous to essentially nuke the world you spent decades, or even centuries, to reach, with a loose or broken piece of hardware – so all of your protuberances and extrusions need to be pulled in to minimize your ship’s cross section again when you are in a system, in interplanetary areas. Unless of course you are an invading fleet, in which case all that potential debris becomes your target’s problem rather than yours. Though speaking of space freighters, those are probably one of those things you’d only see in science fiction - specifically of the giant mega-freighters plowing through deep space variety. There’s plenty of room for freighters, but if we’re talking about moving large quantities of raw materials around, realistically, those huge container freighters really aren’t the best way to ship your resources. Instead, you’d attach a small ship to a large payload, essentially a slowboat, meekly cruising back towards the world or habitat or station that requires the materials, taking many years to arrive. A megaton of iron is just as valuable when it is on its way as it is the moment you acquire it. Let’s consider 3 likely cargos of raw materials one might haul around in the future. Ice, Gas, and metal ores. Let’s start with ice. Water in any form is rare in the inner system – outside of Earth, of course – but out past the asteroid belt, past the “frost line,” there are innumerable icy bodies, asteroids, comets, and ice-covered moons around the gas giants. This makes the concept of transporting large quantities of water very logical; if you’re building rotating habitats in the inner system, you’ll need that water to be shipped in. However, those icy bodies aren’t entirely pure water ice – they typically also contain chemicals such as frozen ammonia, methane, and so on – a little perk, resources that can be put to other uses. If your ship’s job is pushing ice out from Saturn’s Rings or the Kuiper Belt, that’s exactly what you would do: push it. You wouldn’t cut the icy body into pieces and haul them into a massive freighter, you’d simply attach your ship, which is probably rather small, to the icy body and use your engines to accelerate the body towards your destination. However, you really aren’t just shoving the cargo – you don’t want to send a comet rocketing into the inner system on a ballistic trajectory. You will probably arrive at the ice with equipment that is basically a set of extra engines and a protective wrap. As you push the ice in-system, if it is unprotected, it will start to melt and outgas – which is what gives us those beautiful comet tails we all know. So you’ll want to wrap the ice in some sort of thermal protection – something that will keep the ice cold and frozen even as you approach the warmer inner system. You’ll want the wrap to maintain some pressure inside, so that any phase changes that do occur will be the ice melting into a liquid, instead of sublimating into a vapor. The wrap will also probably be reflective, especially to infrared radiation. While comets are beautiful to see, in this situation, we definitely want to avoid losing all that precious water. However, any sublimation and outgassing could make handy propellants to push that comet around, and an alternative to wrapping the comet. You could follow the comet closely and collect the gas and vapor so you don’t lose those resources to the vacuum. Once collected, you have many options for using these gasses: process the mix and separate all the molecules. Electrolyze the water to get the hydrogen to dump into your fusion drive or reactor. Or perhaps your ship has great mirrors or solar sails, which you can use to reflect and focus an energy beam at the comet to sublimate the ice into natural propellant. This superheated gas and vapor would push the comet in-system quite powerfully, and would get to its destination more quickly. However, this method requires some decision making; how much of that material are you willing to lose in order to get the comet to its destination faster? You might of course do this entirely automated, but if you need on-site crew, they need a place to live, and you’re never going to be in a rush on ice, since the slower you go the higher your profit, minus the cost of salaries and equipment maintenance, which I’d imagine will be the dominant factors in deciding how slow you can push ice. They’re going to want to make a bit of a home out of that place, and of course might carve in ice tunnels or extract minerals to build more stuff – icy bodies typically have plenty of rock mixed in there too. This gets one thinking about ore freighters as well. Now you might opt to move a metal or carbon rich asteroid this same way. If that’s the case, given that many a freighter or colony ship might also be a mobile refinery and factory, they might not be moving raw materials but instead be making stuff out of them or refining as they go. I should also note that ship hulls and space habitat hulls are likely to be fairly generic, so you might start moving an asteroid and turning bits of it into a ship plating and end with a classic big space freighter full of a mix of ore, refined metal, and manufactured goods, all surrounded by cheap, standardized hull plating you could also sell at your destination. One-use freighters in a sense, with a core ship for the crew and sophisticated components you couldn’t make en route. As to moving gas, the reality is that you probably would not, in favor of pressurizing and cooling it enough to be a liquid or solid. A great big balloon is going to leak on you, both from all the extra debris it might be punctured by from its larger size, and because any container has to be able to keep tiny gas molecules from slipping through, and that’s very hard to do with hydrogen for instance since its smaller than the atoms of the container material. So a gas freighter might end up looking a bit more like our classic image as it probably would be a ton of tanks filled with gas or liquid strapped to a ship. That crew doesn’t really need much room compared to the sizes involved, especially in terms of the habitat drum. This is all assuming you even need a crew but as we often mention on this show, the concept of a sophisticated ship computer able to replace a human crew doesn’t necessarily mean its ‘unmanned’. By and large you don’t need much brains for navigating space but many of the other tasks might start edging into an area where you need something animal-smart, and if it needs human-smart, you use a human. Or a person anyway, even if they might never have been born in the classic sense. Artificial intelligence is a rather vague concept when you get to higher levels. Whether it’s an unmanned ship or a manned one, and for all the vagueness of that term in a futuristic sense, a ship is always going to have a computer on board. What else does it need? Well air and water and warmth if anything biological is in play, and a means to clean and recycle both. It’s tempting to assume spaceships will always have gardens or hydroponics onboard if people are on board, but plants aren’t the most mass-efficient way to scrub carbon dioxide out of the air. Short-run ships or those that need to accelerate fast like a warship probably wouldn’t bother. For everyone else, it offers at least a supplement of fresh food and something green to look at. Your crew needs to bring some home along though, and will always try to, within the limitations of the ship and mission. A ship that needs to be able to accelerate very fast and suddenly might have problems keeping a garden or hydroponics bay going so it doesn’t get smashed around by the sudden jerks or effective high-gravity, but I suspect that would simply results in lots of inventions to make it practical rather than abstaining from having them. When it comes to living quarters, ‘as close to home as possible’ will always apply, and where it can’t we either do our best, go without, or modify ourselves for it to not matter. That could be a minor thing like everyone wearing sunglasses and sunscreen because the ship or work environment in space was heavily flooded with UV light, or more likely the reverse, having sunrooms you could sit in that let you soak up the rays while the ship tended to be otherwise dim. Alternatively it could be big stuff like modifying a human to not need gravity, or handle gravity and acceleration better, or even uploading minds into computers or cyborgs to handle extreme conditions like acceleration or radiation. Ships that spend a lot of time cruising or only undergo weak long accelerations like an ion drive , rather than fast burns like chemical rockets, are generally going to be able to have a much more regular layout of things like dining and food preparation and bathrooms and gardens. Alternatively, ships that do have to be ready for rapid burns need to have very specialized and specific places for eating, drinking, disposing of waste, and even sleeping. You might need to strap in. If the ship needs to be able to rapidly accelerate on short notice, you need padded walls or airbags in them, because a sudden 5-g burn might slam someone into the ceiling or wall of a corridor hard enough to shatter their bones. You might go the other way though and include padded suits instead, or pad objects that might not be secured. Pet collars on such a maneuverable spaceship, and I’m sure most with crews would have pets too, would likely feature air bags or balloons that could act as impromptu life support bubbles. Amusingly a coffee cup might have an accelerometer in it that triggered a lid and blew out a balloon, many tools might too. We often see boarding parties in science fiction fighting through corridors, but less so debris bouncing around or the combatants trying to blast or squirm through corridors that have blown out airbags down their length. On any such ship though, every bit of equipment is going to be secured when not in use and likely attached to tethers even when in use. A hammer or screwdriver kicked down a corridor by a rapid burn is a lethal object. Such ships wouldn’t have large rotating sections much either. We often picture stations or ships that provide gravity by rotation as being the whole thing rotating, but as we’ve noted in other episodes, usually the rotating section would be inside a larger superstructure, and on a ship, except a classic slowboat generation ark ship, that rotating drum is likely to be only a small part. They are a place for sleeping and relaxation or stationary work, like offices, kitchens, or workshops. A ship doesn’t have to have only one drum though, it can have several of various sizes, even nested inside each other and providing different levels of gravity. Your issue there is that the smaller in diameter a drum is, the more times per minute it needs to rotate to produce the same gravity. Evidence suggests 2 RPM is beneath our threshold to feel nauseous but more RPMs are probably easy to acclimate to. That limits how small a drum can be, though it can be smaller if you don’t need full gravity and odds are some small workshop in a distant corner of a ship only needs enough gravity so stuff falls and things feel up and down, moon gravity might be enough. Propulsion is important for how a ship will be laid out inside, but of course it’s a big deal for overall ship configuration too. Indeed in the case of a ship attempting to achieve high delta-v, meaning a high cruise velocity, the so-called propulsion bus may have to represent the bulk of total mass: the “payload”, where you’d have crew quarters, cargo and life support, would look relatively small even if it’s in the thousands of tons, and it would be dwarfed by the engines, waste heat removal systems &#x2F; radiators, and the fuel tanks, which may be the largest part of the ship, to obtain a high mass ratio. Let’s talk a little more about streamlining the outside of ships though. For the most part, as I mentioned earlier, ships don’t need be streamlined other than to cut down on overall mass and cross section, and might feature a lot of retractable equipment in exterior bays so you could store them under more cover when not in use and make it easier to get at them for repairs, be it antennas or radiators or sensors or big point-defense guns. We’ve got some special cases for streamlining though. Needless to say if you want your ship to be able to land on a planet or move into a gas giant it needs streamlining. Such ships have an excuse for more of the jet or plane look, as they have to deal with lift since they are going through air and gravity fields. However space is not a true vacuum and at high enough speeds even in intergalactic space, as close to true vacuum as you can get outside a lab, it can act like air giving drag and friction, though not lift, or much anyway. If you’re flying above a galaxy at ultra-relativistic speeds you might get a tiny amount of lift you needed to account for. This does mean relativistic ships want to have a nose on them, so that if stuff hits, it deflects away, rather than just impacting against a flat wall. Of course at such speeds even a grain of sand is like a big bomb but it still helps to have that nose-cone, and I was apparently rather unintentionally ambiguous about that in our Interstellar Travel Challenges episode where we looked at the issues and options for ships moving at a decent percentage of light speed. I also mentioned there that you probably would never want to build a ship that ever went anywhere near light speed, but there are cases and setups where that would make sense. All the gas and dust lying around will be acting as drag, and even a ship with infinite fuel, either by some magic clarketech or by a pushing laser, will eventually reach a maximum speed where the ship drive or pushing laser equals out in thrust to the drag of the interstellar or intergalactic medium Even if you do reach highly relativistic speeds, you have a new problem, because even if you can clear out every speck of debris in front of you, that ambient radiation everywhere in the universe becomes a problem. A really skinny ship with a magic stardrive can potentially get insanely fast, but would rely on technology we have not even an inkling of yet, and maybe ever. A pushing laser can be done though but introduces a new problem. A great big sail or mirror on the back also massively increases your ships cross section. The better you can focus that beam the smaller that cross section can be, but even if you can pull off a long relay of pushing stations so the beam is always tight, you still get an issue with light red shifting, and blue shifting. The faster you’re going, the more red-shifted the pushing beam will be, and thus the weaker it is and the less thrust it offers. On the flip side, all the ambient radiation you’re plowing through will be more blue shifted, and thus provide more thrust against you. Inside a galaxy this radiation drag is going to be way less than from all the gas and dust, even keeping in mind that there’s a lot more ambient radiation from all those stars. Out in the intergalactic void though you still have to tackle Cosmic Background Microwave Radiation, which is evenly dispersed everywhere. Far, far in the distant future this will grow ever weaker, as it redshifts as the Universe expands, but right now it places a barrier at about a gamma of 133, according to calculations by Colin McInnes in his book “Solar Sailing”, where the red shifted pushing beam and the blue-shifted CMB radiation equalize out. Gamma by the way is the term for the Lorentz-factor in Special Relativity, we’ve discussed that more in other episodes but for a quick abridged version, this is how much time slows down for you relative to the outside universe or how much of your total energy is in kinetic motion rather than mass energy. A gamma of 133 would mean 133 seconds would pass on other people’s clocks for every second you experienced, or basically a bit over two minutes for each of your seconds. It also means you’d be moving at 99.9972% of light speed. In other words, if you were making the trip to the Andromeda Galaxy at this speed, 2.5 million light years away, you would personally experience only 19,000 years on the voyage. At that speed incidentally the light from any signal sent when you left would only arrive about a century before you on your 2.5 million year journey. I doubt you could ever get to that speed, but it does mean that even if you do, your intergalactic crews still either need radical life extension or very-multi-generation-ships for the trips. Even frozen crews, as we mentioned in Sleeper Ships, need special measures to be taken to avoid being killed by buildup of radiation damage from the tiny amounts given off by the radioactive potassium isotopes in your bones and other isotopes in your body. Such ships can start slowing by just cutting off their pushing laser. Slowing down cost fuel and energy, so you want to get all the freebies you can, and at these speeds you’d start by slowing using ambient blue-shifted energy, then cosmic gas and dust, then hopefully by vanguard probes hitting stars ahead of you and building pushing lasers to slow you, using the technique we discussed in Exodus Fleet. Magnetic sails can also help you with deceleration, their effectiveness increases with initial speed, and even today’s proposed designs could allow a braking rate of several milligees, though it may be less in intergalactic space due to its lesser density. The faster you’re going though, the more each mote of dust or photon you collide with reduces your speed, and here we see yet again how much ship design has to vary with things specific to purpose rather than technology available let alone any constant rules of ship design that apply across all levels of mission purpose, technology, and aesthetics. I’ll also note though before we close out that what we think of as a cool looking spaceship, or machine, often is altered by our exposure to it. When you get around to a rocket or a jet or a sportscar don’t look that particularly awesome until you know what they can do, and your mind tends to start altering what you think is cool to look at. Your default spaceship is likely to look a lot more boring and plain than what we see in scifi, but our descendants in the future might think those designs look pretty cool.","categories":[{"name":"Space","slug":"Space","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Space/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Pilot 飞行","slug":"Pilot-飞行","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Pilot-%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C/"}]},{"title":"Turbofan ✇ 涡轮风扇","slug":"2021-05-01-15-47-turbofan","date":"2021-05-01T07:47:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:27:53.865Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/05/01/2021-05-01-15-47-turbofan/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/05/01/2021-05-01-15-47-turbofan/","excerpt":"Jet engines, which are also called gas turbines, work by sucking air into the front of the engine using a fan.

From there, the engine compresses the air, mixes fuel with it, ignites the fuel&#x2F;air mixture, and shoots it out the back of the engine, creating thrust. A turbofan engine, sometimes referred to as a fanjet or bypass engine, is a jet engine variant which produces thrust using a combination of jet core efflux and bypass air which has been accelerated by a ducted fan that is driven by the jet core. The FanThe first part of the turbofan is the fan. It’s also the part that you can see when you’re looking at the front of a jet. The fan, which almost always is made of titanium blades, sucks in tremendous quantities of air into the engine. The air moves through two parts of the engine. Some of the air is directed into the engine’s core, where the combustion will occur. The rest of the air, called “bypass air”, is moved around the outside of the engine core through a duct. This bypass air creates additional thrust, cools the engine, and makes the engine quieter by blanketing the exhaust air that’s exiting the engine. In today’s modern turbofans, bypass air produces the majority of an engine’s thrust. The CompressorThe compressor is located in the first part of the engine core. And it, as you probably have guessed, compresses the air. The compressor, which is called an “axial flow compressor”, uses a series of airfoil-shaped spinning blades to speed up and compress the air. It’s called axial flow, because the air passes through the engine in a direction parallel to the shaft of the engine (as opposed to centrifugal flow). As the air moves through the compressor, each set of blades is slightly smaller, adding more energy and compression to the air. In between each set of compressor blades are non-moving airfoil-shaped blades called “stators”. These stators (which are also called vanes), increase the pressure of the air by converting the rotational energy into static pressure. The stators also prepare the air for entering the next set of rotating blades. In other words, they “straighten” the flow of air. When combined, a pair of rotating and stationary blades is called a stage. The CombustorThe case contains all the parts of the combustor, and inside it, the diffuser is the first part that does work. The diffuser slows down the air from the compressor, making it easier to ignite. The dome and swirler add turbulence to the air so it can more easily mix with fuel. And the fuel injector, as you probably guessed, sprays fuel into the air, creating a fuel&#x2F;air mixture that can be ignited. From there, the liner is where the actual combustion happens. The liner has several inlets, allowing air to enter at multiple points in the combustion zone. The last main part is the igniter, which is very similar to the spark plugs in your car or piston-engine airplane. Once the igniter lights the fire, it is self-sustaining, and the igniter is turned off (although it’s often used as a back-up in bad weather and icing conditions). The TurbineOnce the air makes its way through the combustor, it flows through the turbine. The turbine is a series of airfoil-shaped blades that are very similar to the blades in the compressor. As the hot, high-speed air flows over the turbine blades, they extract energy from the air, spinning the turbine around in a circle, and turning the engine shaft that it’s connected to.The combustor is where the fire happens. As air exits the compressor and enters the combustor, it is mixed with fuel, and ignited. It sounds simple, but it’s actually a very complex process. That’s because the combustor needs to maintain a stable combustion of fuel&#x2F;air mixture, while the air is moving through the combustor at an extremely fast rate. This is the same shaft that the fan and compressor are connected to, so by spinning the turbine, the fan and compressor on the front of the engine continue sucking in more air that will soon be mixed with fuel and burned. The NozzleThe last step of the process happens in the nozzle. The nozzle is essentially the exhaust duct of the engine, and it’s where the high-speed air shoots out the back. This is also the part where Sir Isaac Newton’s third law comes into play: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Put simply, by forcing air out the back of the engine at high-speed, the airplane is pushed forward. In some engines, there’s a mixer in the exhaust nozzle as well. This simply mixes some of the bypass air flowing around the engine with the hot, combusted air, making the engine quieter. To start an engine on the Boeing 737, a number of tasks in a checklist has to be followed. The ones directly concerning engine operation are: Aircraft’s Electrical Power has to be established for operation of two computers that plays a vital role in a successful engine start, Electronic Engine Control located on the right side of the engines, and Display Electronics Unit located in aircraft’s electronic compartment. Fuel Pumps of the aircraft have to be turned on, this transfers low pressure fuel from the fuel tanks to the engine’s bar valve. In order to crank the engine, pneumatic power is required. Three sources of pneumatic power can be used by connecting an external jet starter unit. From the other engine if it’s running, or from the APU which is the standard practice.Ignition switch position has to be changed. For redundancy each engine has two ignition system, left and right, standard procedure requires to change the switch position before each start. Now that the engine is configured for start. Turn the engine start switch to ground start position, a solenoid controlled by display electronics unit latches and holds the switch. The start switch now sends an electrical signal to the start valve on the engine fan case to open, the pneumatic power reaches the starter.The starter which is an air-driven motor, consisting of turbine reduction gears, and clutch turns the output shaft of the accessory gearbox on the engine. The output shaft of the gearbox turns the N2 rotor of the engine on which are mounted high pressure compressors and high pressure turbine.N2 rotation induces air suction into the engine. As a result, the N1 rotor of the engine on which the fan low pressure compressors and low pressure turbines are mounted begins to rotate marginally.Speed sensors send the rotation speed of the N2 and N1 rotors to DEU, which displays them in the cockpit, the N2 reaches 25% of its maximum rpm, the engine has now reached the maximum motoring stage. Now move the start lever from cut off to idle position. The start lever causes engine fuel spar valve to open, and fuel reaches the engine shutoff valve. The start lever also sends an electrical signal to the electronic engine control.The EEC commands the engine shutoff valve to open transferring fuel to the engine fuel pump mounted on the accessory gearbox. The fuel pump increases the fuel pressure and transfers it to the fuel metering valve.EEC now controls the rate of fuel flow by controlling the fuel metering valve, which transfers the fuel into the combustion chamber through the fuel nozzles. At the same time, EEC commands the ignition exciter box to ignite the fuel air mixture in the combustion chamber with the help of igniter plug.The combustion increases high pressure and low pressure turbines rotation , this shoots up the N1 and N2 rotors rpm. Thermocouple sensors send the exhaust gas temperature data to the EEC. EEC monitors engine parameters and if it notices any anomaly immediately cuts off the fuel supply and ignition. At 56% N2, the engine reaches a self-sustainable level. The DEU removes the ground from start switch solenoid and the switch goes to off position, this removes the power to the start valve, which closes to stop the pneumatic supply to starter.The reduction in pressure reduces starter speed, which disengages the clutch isolating the starter from the engine gearbox rotation. As the temperature inside combustion chamber is enough for continuous fuel air mixture ignition, EEC deactivates the ignition system. Now the engine has reached the idle stage. In order to increase the engine thrust to high power, move the thrust lever ahead, resolver sends an output voltage proportional to the thrust lever angle to the EEC.The EEC according to the position increases the fuel flow rate through the fuel metering valve. By supplying more fuel for combustion, the EEC increases the thrust of the engine to maximum power. To shut down the engine, move the thrust lever back to idle. This will decrease fuel flow for combustion and the engine will go back to the idle speed, then move the start lever to cut off, this will stop the fuel flow and the engine will gradually come to an halt.

When unspecified, “time dilation” usually refers to the effect due to velocity. After compensating for varying signal delays due to the changing distance between an observer and a moving clock (i.e. Doppler effect), the observer will measure the moving clock as ticking slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer’s own reference frame. In addition, a clock that is close to a massive body (and which therefore is at lower gravitational potential) will record less elapsed time than a clock situated further from the said massive body (and which is at a higher gravitational potential). These predictions of the theory of relativity have been repeatedly confirmed by experiment, and they are of practical concern, for instance in the operation of satellite navigation systems such as GPS and Galileo. High-accuracy timekeeping, low-Earth-orbit satellite tracking, and pulsar timing are applications that require the consideration of the combined effects of mass and motion in producing time dilation. Practical examples include the International Atomic Time standard and its relationship with the Barycentric Coordinate Time standard used for interplanetary objects. Relativistic time dilation effects for the solar system and the Earth can be modeled very precisely by the Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations.

This sum includes any tidal potentials. The coordinate velocity of the clock is given by: $$v^{2}&#x3D;\\frac{d x^{2}+d y^{2}+d z^{2}}{d t_{\\mathrm{c}}^{2}}$$ The coordinate time $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the time that would be read on a hypothetical “coordinate clock” situated infinitely far from all gravitational masses (U&#x3D;0), and stationary in the system of coordinates (v&#x3D;0). The exact relation between the rate of proper time and the rate of coordinate time for a clock with a radial component of velocity is: $$\\frac{d t_{\\mathrm{E}}}{d t_{\\mathrm{c}}}&#x3D;\\sqrt{1+\\frac{2 U}{c^{2}}-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}+\\left(\\frac{c^{2}}{2 U}+1\\right)^{-1} \\frac{v_{\\text {॥ }}^{2}}{c^{2}}}&#x3D;\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\beta^{2}+\\beta_{e}^{2}+\\frac{\\beta_{\\text {॥ }}^{2} \\beta_{e}^{2}}{1-\\beta_{e}^{2}}\\right)}$$ where: $v_{\\text {॥ }}^{2}$ is the radial velocity,$v_{e}&#x3D;\\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{i}}{r_{i}}}$ is the escape speed,$\\beta&#x3D;v &#x2F; c$, $\\beta_{e}&#x3D;v_{e} &#x2F; c$, $\\beta_{\\text {॥ }}&#x3D;v_{\\text {॥ }} &#x2F; c$ are velocities as a percentage of speed of light c,$U&#x3D;\\frac{-G M_{i}}{r_{i}}$ is the Newtonian potential; hence -U equals half the square of the escape speed. The above equation is exact under the assumptions of the Schwarzschild solution. It reduces to velocity time dilation equation in the presence of motion and absence of gravity, i.e. $\\beta_{e}&#x3D;0$. It reduces to gravitational time dilation equation in the absence of motion and presence of gravity, i.e. $\\beta&#x3D;0&#x3D;\\beta_{\\text {॥ }}$. One evening in the spring of 1905, Albert Einstein, then a patent clerk in Bern, after trudging through his day’s work decided to board a tram car on his way home. Einstein would often wrap up his work as soon as possible to contemplate the truths of the universe in his free time. It was one of these thought experiments he devised on that tram car that revolutionized modern physics forever. While receding away from the Zytglogge clock tower, Einstein imagined, what would happen if the tram car were receding at the speed of light. He realized that if he were to travel at 186,000 miles per second the clocks hands would appear to completely freeze. At the same time Einstein knew that back at the clock tower the hands would tick along at their normal pace. For Einstein, time had slowed down. This thought blew his mind. Einstein concluded that the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. How is this possible? Einstein’s work was heavily influenced by two of the most iconic physicists of all time. First there were the laws of motion discovered by his idol Isaac Newton and second were the laws of electromagnetism, laid down by James Clerk Maxwell. Newton’s laws insisted that velocities are never absolute. But always relative, so that their magnitudes must be appended by the phrase “with respect to”. For instance, a train travels at 40 km&#x2F;h with respect to someone at rest. However, it only travels 20 km&#x2F;h with respect to a train traveling 20 km&#x2F;h in the same direction. Or it travels 60 km&#x2F;h with respect to another train traveling in the opposite direction at 20 km&#x2F;h. This is also true for the velocities of Earth, the Sun and the entire Milky Way galaxy. On the other hand Maxwell found that the speed of an electromagnetic wave such as light is fixed at an exorbitant 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s, regardless of who observes it. However Maxwell’s notion seems incompatible with Newton’s notion of relative velocities. If Newton’s laws are truly universal, why should the speed of life be an exception? This presented Einstein with a daunting dilemma. This conflict between the ideas of Newton and Maxwell can be demonstrated with another of Einstein’s brilliant thought experiments. Einstein imagined himself on a train platform, witnessing two lightning bolts strike on either side of him. Now because Einstein stands precisely in the middle of the two strikes. He receives the resulting beams of light from both sides at the same time. However, things get more complicated when someone on a passing train views this event while whizzing past Einstein at the speed of light. If the speed of light conforms to the rules of relativity, then the person on the train wouldn’t witness the lightning strike simultaneously. Logically the light closer to the man on the train would reach him first. A measurement of the speed of light made by both men would differ in magnitude, this would contradict an apparently fundamental truth of the universe. Einstein had to make a difficult choice. Either Newton’s laws were incomplete or the speed of light was not a universal constant. Einstein realized that the two notions could coexist with a small tweak in Newton’s laws. To get rid of the discrepancy in the measurements, Einstein suggested the time itself for the man on the train must slow down to compensate for the decrease in speed, such that the magnitude remains a constant. Einstein called this absurdity “Time Dilation” and his newfound theory “Special Relativity”. Newton believed the time moved unflinchingly in a single direction forward. Einstein, however had just realized the time stretches and contracts varying with velocity. Due to its malleability time like space Deserved its own dimension. In fact Einstein claimed that the two were one and the same. Together they formed a four-dimensional fabric or continuum called space-time upon which the mundane events of the universe would unfold. Einstein Suggested that massive objects like the Sun didn’t pull bodies like earth with a mysterious Inexplicable tug, but rather curved the fabric of space-time around them, forcing earth to fall down into this steep valley. A highly simplified analogy is the dip in a trampoline made by a falling bowling ball. If a marble were placed on that trampoline the marble would immediately roll towards the bowling ball in the center. This is also true for Earth’s gravity. We are pinned to the ground because space so distorted by the Earth’s mass, pushes us down from above. However the slump in the fabric around Earth is not uniform and Earth’s gravity grows more intense as we move towards its center, where the curvature is at a maximum. Therefore like the marble on the trampoline an object that falls towards the earth accelerates as it races towards the center of the planet. It falls faster when just above the surface than it does say when it is slightly above the atmosphere. But hey, according to special relativity, the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. This means that time runs slower on Earth’s surface than it does above the atmosphere. Now, because different planets have different masses and thus different gravitational strengths, they also accelerate objects at different rates as we have learned this means a variable passage of time. This is what happens in the movie interstellar when the protagonists land on a planet in the proximity of a black hole, the gravity on the planet is so severe that one hour on the surface is equivalent to seven years on earth. To understand how motion affects time, let’s consider the simplest timekeeping mechanism. A second passes each time the photon is reflected. Let’s imagine two people one in a spaceship slightly above Earth’s atmosphere, and the second on top of a small hill, just above the Earth’s surface. Both are watching a man fall from space towards the ground. Let’s say that the falling man is carrying the photon clock explained a moment ago. What do each of the two men observe as the man falls past them? What they observe is eerily similar to what a stationary person would observe, when watching a ball bounce in a moving train? As the man falls from space, the light in his clock would appear to move in triangles to the two observers. This would mean that the light travels a longer distance consequently stretching the duration of a second. It is obvious that the length of triangles the light traces and therefore the duration of a second is proportional to the velocity of the falling man. When we recall that objects closer to the center of the planet fall faster, we can determine the time would appear to pass slower to the man on the hill than it does to the man in the spaceship above. Of course the difference is infinitesimal. The difference between the time measured by clocks at the tops of mountains and at the surface of Earth is a matter of nanoseconds. Time Dilation affects every clock whether it relies on basic electromagnetism or a complex combination of Electromagnetism and Newton’s laws of motion. In fact even biological processes are slowed down. Yes, that’s right, your head is slightly older than your feet.","categories":[{"name":"Time","slug":"Time","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Time/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Martian 👨🏻‍🚀 火星人","slug":"2021-03-29-15-16-martian","date":"2021-03-29T07:16:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-17T08:46:33.969Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/03/29/2021-03-29-15-16-martian/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/03/29/2021-03-29-15-16-martian/","excerpt":"MarsLink.in 2028, LandingFive starships land on Mars, marking the beginnings of the Mars colony.All of the martian rovers sent by different countries before this day.Watch as the five uncrewed starships land and deliver life support systems,these pioneering starships pave the way for humans to land on Mars in two years time, for fishes to be grown in nine years, and for the first baby to be born on the red planet in 15 years time.","text":"MarsLink.in 2028, LandingFive starships land on Mars, marking the beginnings of the Mars colony.All of the martian rovers sent by different countries before this day.Watch as the five uncrewed starships land and deliver life support systems,these pioneering starships pave the way for humans to land on Mars in two years time, for fishes to be grown in nine years, and for the first baby to be born on the red planet in 15 years time. 27 April 2028, Location: Erebus MontesThe five starships land at Erebus Montes.The cargo ships are delivering essential life support systems.These are made up of solar panels backup fuel, oxygen, water, dried food,waste management systems, spacesuits, medical supplies and the first habitation pods.There are also tools and equipment for experiments. One of the starships is carrying Mars’s new starlink communications network, and deploys it in orbit before landing to deliver life-support cargo. Only four satellites are needed to create the martian starlink, as the Mars base will be concentrated to one area. There are also seven football fields worth of solar panels on the cargo list.These are used to power the future base and fuel production solar panels on Mars are only 43% as efficient as they are on earth. Rovers as well as robotic dogs by Boston Dynamics which SpaceX uses to inspect rockets on earth are deployed from the starships to the martian surface. Work begins on setting up the Mars base, the rovers and robots deploy the solar arrays, prep work begins for fuel production experiments, rovers begin drilling for icy water deposits. The saboteer process is used to take the CO² from the martian atmosphere and hydrogen from mining martian icy water, and then uses heat and pressure to turn it into water oxygen and methane fuel. Multi-use rovers begin flattening and melting the martian regolith the loose soil to prepare a large flat landing pad it reduces the kick-up of dirt and rocks, increasing the safety for the next landings. The population on Mars is made up entirely of robots two years and two months have passed since the first landings of the five cargo starships and the new launch window opens as earth and Mars are close together again. 20 June 2031, Day 1Two starships carrying a total of 30 astronauts land on Mars, 10 additional cargo ships accompany them carrying an oversupply of life support. These first astronaut settlers are scientists, engineers, medical specialists and military personnel with scientific backgrounds. They all have to stay on Mars for the full two years and two months. This is not a short-term visit. It is a mission to make life sustainable and multi-planetary. During the first week on Mars, the astronauts are suffering from the effects of low gravity after the seven month journey and have weaker muscles. The first week is used to acclimate to the gravity of the red planet and celebrate surviving the journey. The new settlers live in their starships that they landed in the crew begins to adapt to their new surroundings. Life on Mars is harsh. The average temperature outside is -63°C or -81°F with a maximum of 20°C (68°F) in the summer at the equator. Wind storms are common on Mars they lift rust-colored dust into the atmosphere that can cover the entire planet. Mars also experiences quakes orbiters that are monitoring the climate on Mars act as weather satellites warning astronauts of incoming dust storms and changes in the weather. The two-year-long work schedule begins. Days on the red planet are a little over 24 hours. The workday of unpacking and carrying heavy objects is made easier as the gravity on Mars is only 38% of that on earth. Once the life support systems have been unpacked and deployed, the next priority is testing and starting production of cryomethane fuel. The fuel is needed for the return trip to earth. A small crew of astronauts begin conducting experiments that test turning the martian soil into a 3D printing material. The green project also gets underway to start growing plants indoors. Settlers begin cultivating the martian soil. NASA has packed designer plants that have been genetically engineered to grow on Mars and testing begins on the cyanobacteria that was transported from earth. This organism is used to produce ammonia fertilizer from the nitrogen in the martian atmosphere. Crops such as rye, radishes, tomatoes, beans, carrots and potatoes are grown, and the astronauts waste is recycled as fertilizer for the plants. Soon the Mars base will have a delivery of fishes. On earth, SpaceX now has factories that are producing two starships per week. Each one costing five million dollars to build, 104 starships are built per year and 216 starships are ready for each launch window. Earth and Mars orbit around the sun at different speeds, so there is only a launch window every two years and two months when earth and Mars are at their closest. During each launch window year there are only a few days as low as 12 to launch, and four each day the launch window ranges from only 30 minutes to 2 hours, so a combination of cargo and crude starships are built waiting ready to be launched when the window opens. Back on Mars, one starship launches heading back to earth, carrying on board the entire 30-person crew who have lived on the red planet for over two years. 11 July 2033, Day 752With the landing of the second group of settlers, humans now surpass robots as the majority population. The first architect arrives along with four privately paying individuals who are paying 50 million dollars each. The rest of the crew are scientists, engineers and botanist farmers. The first set of small permanent greenhouse domes are constructed, adding to the number of plants being grown on Mars. The settlers eat the first martian salad. A small portion of the food on the planet now comes from locally grown produce. This slowly reduces the amount of food that needs to be transported from earth on future missions. SpaceX begins construction of the Depot X. The first permanent dedicated fueling station on Mars, and work begins on the first 3D printed habitat. The AI space factory 3D printer uses a mixture of martian soil and lab-grown plants which act as the glue, the polymer that holds the material together. The 3D printed outer shell of the new habitat provides protection from radiation while an inflatable inner shell is added for extra safety. Parts are deconstructed from one of the starships to create the communications and life support systems for the new 3D printed habitat. 18 August 2035, Day 1520As more sophisticated 3D printing robots arrive, larger hydroponic crop facilities are built, generating the majority of the food for the martian settlers. Kimball musk even has a team working on Mars with their own vertical farm. The settlers begin testing underground digging for habitat purposes, data is sent back to the boring company on earth. 24 September 2037, Day 2288Space agencies from all around the world are now sending their own equipment and scientists to Mars base alpha. The domain name amazon.Mars is registered by Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin plans to open for delivery to Mars for space agencies first and then later for private clients. The new starship crew have transported fishes from earth to create an aquaponic greenhouse as there is now enough water being made on Mars. The first funeral is held, the settler is cremated and spread across the martian landscape. Back at earth a fleet of starships full of fuel cargo and passengers is waiting in low earth orbit. When the launch window opens, they fly as a fleet to Mars the spacecrafts are able to support and dock with each other if needed during the seven month journey. 17 November 2039, Day 3072The year 2035, this year will be known as the great crossing earth and Mars are closer than usual this is known as a perihelic opposition the journey is shortened from seven months to five. Hundreds of settlers now land on the red planet, autonomous industrial scale 3D printers are now used to grow the base. The international habitat expands, and becomes a town-sized settlement of interconnected domes. The construction of the first martian hospital begins and a growing number of people decide to remain on Mars as more facilities are built. 10 February 2042, Day 3888The first people with the intention of becoming permanent residents arrive on Mars. The colony crosses the 1,000 person mark. There is even a small scale TV show that is made on the red planet. The first martian marriage is watched across earth and Mars while exploration missions discover cave systems suitable for the development of protected underground habitats. 20 April 2044, Day 4688The Boring Company tunnel digger lands on Mars, and begins testing digging underground tunnels for shielded passageways, and for underground habitat construction. This marks the beginning of Elon Musk’s Boring Mars Company. Robotic bases are now present at different locations, further away from the main base. They act as mining outposts and nation states begin constructing smaller habitats away from the base. They become embassies on Mars and architectural design moves habitats from purely functional constructions to expressive symbols of national pride. The first person is born on Mars, scientists study the health of the mother and baby closely. 19 June 2046, Day 5478A large number of the new arrivals are now commercially paying two-year stay customers. All travelers are still required to contribute in growing the Mars society. With over 7,000 people now on Mars, the first martian political system is created. Local policies are needed to help govern the residents of Mars and keep pushing the mission of being self-sustaining as a matter of survival for the colony. The first restaurant opens on Mars serving bio-printed food including meat. 17 August 2050, Day 6998The first bio-printer arrives, it is used at the hospital to test the printing of human parts.A dedicated maternity ward is opened at the hospital to deal with the increase of births from the martian residents. The first parts of a nuclear fusion power plant begins construction, reducing the need for additional solar panels that are sent with each mission from earth. 16 October 2050, Day 70582046, the year of the martian explorers. The first person climbs olympus mons. It is two and a half times taller than mount everest, making it the tallest mountain and volcano in the solar system. The nine and a half month journey tests the limits of the new flexible spacesuits.The first mrna manufacturing facility is operational, allowing the people of Mars to be vaccinated for when they return to earth. Schools are now being built as workers begin to move their families to Mars. 14 December 2052, Day 7848Blue Origin’s first fully autonomous orbiting manufacturing station arrives in Mars orbit. The space station processes asteroids for rare materials. It is done in space so that the Mars atmosphere is not polluted. Manufactured goods are then sent down to the martian surface. Elon Musk opens the first Tesla Gigafactory on Mars. Here they recycle solar panel batteries and assemble open and enclosed electric transporters, and also maintain ATVs and other SpaceX transport vehicles. 12 February 2055, Day 8638The year 2051 is known as the second great crossing. The close orbits of earth and Mars allows for another mass movement of people and equipment. Tens of thousands of people land on the red planet. Government officials from different earth nations make the crossing. Mining companies send management teams and exploration geologists to the planet and establish small company habitats. AI robotics and a productive human workforce now makes Mars fully self-sufficient for all essential goods. The colony produces all of its own power, breathable air, water, food and fuel. If resupply missions from earth were to stop, the Mars colony would survive and grow, but in a primitive way as there is still a need for advanced electronics from earth to keep the colony developing as an advanced civilization. 2 April 2058, Day 9783To mark the 10,000 days humans have settled on Mars, the first Mars-born human visits earth. The traveler is assisted by a robotic suit controlled by a neuralink brain chip that helps support them in the heavy earth gravity. On Mars grasslands and woody plants are thriving in vast enclosed greenhouse domes built over melted ice lakes near the equator. They are slowly adding oxygen to the martian atmosphere. The first strands of grass are found growing wild on the martian surface escaped seedlings from the greenhouses are attempting to survive on the surface of Mars.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Literature 文学","slug":"Literature-文学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Literature-%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Butterfly Effect 🦋 蝴蝶效应","slug":"2021-02-22-22-07-butterfly-effect","date":"2021-02-22T14:07:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T05:08:51.859Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/02/22/2021-02-22-22-07-butterfly-effect/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/02/22/2021-02-22-22-07-butterfly-effect/","excerpt":"The butterfly effect is the idea that small, seemingly trivial events may ultimately result in something with much larger consequences – in other words, they have non-linear impacts on very complex systems.

For instance, when a butterfly flaps its wings in India, that tiny change in air pressure could eventually cause a tornado in Iowa. The term “butterfly effect” was coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz, a meteorology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was studying weather patterns. He devised a model demonstrating that if you compare two starting points indicating current weather that are near each other, they’ll soon drift apart – and later, one area could wind up with severe storms, while the other is calm. Later, other scientists realized the importance of Lorenz’s discovery. His insights laid the foundation for a branch of mathematics known as chaos theory, the idea of trying to predict the behavior of systems that are inherently unpredictable. You can see instances of the butterfly effect every day. Weather’s just one example. Climate change is another. Because, as it turns out, warming climates are impacting – appropriately enough – species of alpine butterflies in North America. 蝴蝶效应是混沌学理论中的一个概念。它是指对初始条件敏感性的一种依赖现象：输入端微小的差别会迅速放大到输出端，蝴蝶效应在经济生活中比比皆是。 “蝴蝶效应”也可称“台球效应”，它是“混沌性系统”对初值极为敏感的形象化术语，也是非线性系统在一定条件（可称为“临界性条件”或“阈值条件”）出现混沌现象的直接原因。 混沌不是偶然的、个别的事件，而是普遍存在于宇宙间各种各样的宏观及微观系统的，万事万物，莫不混沌。 混沌也不是独立存在的科学，它与其它各门科学互相促进、互相依靠，由此派生出许多交叉学科，如混沌气象学、混沌经济学、混沌数学等。 混沌学不仅极具研究价值，而且有现实应用价值，能直接或间接创造财富。 In 1952, an author named Ray Bradbury published a short story called A Sound of Thunder, ended a hunter named Echolls pays $10,000 to travel with time Safari. A time machine company that takes hunters back to the time of dinosaurs and allows them to hunt the T-Rex. The company guarantees nothing, neither your safety nor your return, and there are strict instructions and expectations for how the hunters should behave once they travel back in time. When they travel 60 million years back in time, they noticed the path that has been laid by the company. It floats six inches above the earth, and is the only path that the hunter should travel upon. They cannot touch anything during their stay in the past and they’re only to shoot when told to. Interrupting any of the natural processes in the past could have irreparable repercussions for the future. Step on a mouse and you leave your print, like the Grand Canyon across eternity. They’re very careful with leaving the past just as it was supposed to unfold. The T-Rex that they were supposed to kill was going to be crushed by a tree only seconds later it was going to die anyway. Echols however is terrified and runs back to the time machine through the jungle and waits for the others. But once the rest of the crew returns, they noticed the mud on that goes boots. Against their better judgment they allow him to return with the crew back to prison day. When they exit the time machine the crew checks in with the man behind the desk to see if everything is okay and the man tells him it is. The man however is acting a bit different from before they left there’s a strange smell in the air it’s faint but it’s there. The sign on the wall is different the words were spelled differently. Echols sits down that checks every inch of his body for things that could have ruined, and on his boot caked in the mud he finds a butterfly, beautiful and dead. The death of a single butterfly has somehow resulted in the future being changed, he cries out in this belief, begging to return to the past and somehow undo what he’s done. He sits down, with his eyes closed and senses a crew member enter the room. The crew member briefly and takes the safety off his rifle. Echols opens his eyes, but suddenly all he hears is a sound of thunder. It used to be thought that events that changed the world were things like big bombs, huge earthquakes or other large-scale events. But has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that changed the world are the tiny things. A butterfly flapped its wings in the Amazon and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe. Paraphrased a little bit is a quote from a novel named Good Omens what it’s talking about is the butterfly effect. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions more commonly known as the Butterfly Effect is the idea that a small change in any situation could have huge implications later on down the road. The idea was coined by Edward Lorenz in the 1950s. Lorenz was a meteorologist to a surgery for a means of predicting the weather. He was conducting experiments with various numbers to try and model weather prediction. He did a previous experiment with an initial condition of 0.506127. Six significant digits, a little bit overkill he thought so this time his initial condition was only 0.506. Three significant digits should be fine. So we left the room to get a cup of coffee and came back to something drastically different from what he had previously. At first things seemed normal and they seemed to follow the first experiment one-to-one, but after a while they started to diverge and looked like completely different models. A 0.03% difference in values had enormous long-term implications. It may seem insignificant it’s just a model right. Well, Lorenz had actually just opened the door to a new way of thinking and seeing the world around us. Chaos Theory is the branch of mathematics that focuses on exactly this kind of thinking. But its name is kind of deceiving. Butterfly Effect doesn’t represent chaos but rather the effects of changing the slightest conditions and then observing the results. Think of this it is easier to predict the orbital period of a planet in another star system ten million years from now, than it is for us to predict our own weather here on earth just a month from today. Because in order for us to predict the weather long term, we would have to know the exact position and momentum of every molecule of air on the planet and how they interact with each other. For planetary orbits it’s just a lot easier there’s a lot less of variables, and a university physics student could probably calculate it. As for the weather butterfly flapping his wings creates a minuscule and almost unnoticeable change in atmospheric pressure, but these changes compound over and over and over as time progresses, until as widely known the butterfly’s wings cause tornado in Texas. This inevitable growth of errors is called Deterministic Chaos. Chaos that can be determined measured. However the butterfly itself cannot call as a tornado, the butterfly represents an unknowable quantity. We can never reverse-engineer an event to find out what exactly tipped the system, there’s just too many factors that could have gone into it no choice you’ve ever made has been an isolated event. It’s like a domino effect that keeps compounding over time. The world in society is like a network and when a certain part of that network fails it affects everything else. Chaos Theory isn’t random even though it seems like it. To prove it let’s play Chaos game. Take a piece of paper and make three points like such, we’ll label them A, B and C. Now choose a random point in the middle of those three points, we’ll just put it right here. Now all you have to do is make a point halfway between your starting point and point A, from this point make a point halfway between here and point B, repeat the process for Point C and continue this pattern, rotating between points A, B and C. If you do this for long enough you’ll see something interesting start to happen as more and more generations if these points are drawn an image starts to emerge. From seemingly random points being drawn, from Chaos, from disorder, this complexity yet orderly figure shows its face. From drawing a few points and following certain rules Chaos can form order. It’s a fractal they’re infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across any scale. This shows that with enough time random actions can have serious long-term effects. The Butterfly Effect isn’t exactly how you’d expect science to be. Physics math and many other scientific fields are based on predictability. You know predicting the orbit of planets in order to send satellites of probes there, or predicting the odds of an asteroid hitting the earth. The Butterfly Effect is the complete opposite, it’s a model that exposes the flaws and other models. It says that without a perfect knowledge of initial conditions any prediction is basically useless. But although the Butterfly Effect exposes flaws and other models, it also brings to light the impact that everything including each of us has. Jonas Salk is credited for having found the first vaccines for polio. Had he not discovered that at the time he did, the entire population of the planet today would be vastly different, some people wouldn’t have been born. Entire family lines may have been cut off due to the lack of a vaccine. Perhaps some of the largest companies today would not have been created if it weren’t for this specific event happening at this specific time. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Russian nuclear armed submarines was stationed off the coast of Cuba. American ships detected the submarine and began using depth charges to signal that the submarine should surface. The crew on board though took these depth charges to be bombs, the captain that the ship believed that war had broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union, and ordered a nuclear torpedo to be sent immediately. Everyone agreed except for one officer Vasili arkhipov. Without a unanimous vote no action could be taken and thus World War III was prevented. This one man’s decision is the reason that the United States and Russia today aren’t nuclear wastelands. The Butterfly Effect affects everything. Do you really have control of your life like everything. No, but you and I have huge effects on the world as well. The Butterfly Effect is not to get leverage, it’s not saying that every small thing always has a big impact. If that were true then in a way you couldn’t manipulate it. Think of it like Jenga, you take away a certain block and things can be just fine but another block, that one special block if removed causes everything else to fall apart. The reality is you have no idea what thing or what block will change your future so everything has a say in it. For example you watching a video will take up about 10 minutes of your day, whether it’s for a good reason or not. Could be watching a movie or listening to a song, getting a video idea from it , researching it, writing it, editing it and uploading it to where you see it on your YouTube feed, at a specific time prevent something bad from happening to you. Maybe you watching a video prevented you from going to the store 10 minutes early. Where if you had left 10 minutes ago a car that runs the red light would smash into you in an intersection killing you. It’s a scary thought but it’s a possibility. Someone recently messaged me and said that they had saw someone watching one of my videos in their classroom right next to them. They started to talk become friends and now they’re dating. If YouTube was on a platform if I hadn’t had that specific video idea that wouldn’t have happened, and maybe those two people would have never met. But it goes much further than that, everything has led you and I to this very moment literally everything. Because the universe exists , because the universe is expanding, and because the temperature of the universe was just right to the point that in stellar nurseries can form stars, without those stars we wouldn’t have supernovas, without supernovas we wouldn’t have iron, without iron we couldn’t exist. Every day you breathe I hope and when you exhale you exhale Carbon Dioxide. This Carbon Dioxide through the help of plants and photosynthesis creates more oxygen. Oxygen that people hundreds of years from now might breathe. Everything you do, no matter how small it is will change the future in one way or another. People who lived hundreds of years ago have had an effect on the world as it is today. The things you do today will ripple throughout time. The small things you create today can be the big things that the next generation builds upon, in a way you can live forever. So the next time something big happens in your life, just think it didn’t happen by accident. Just as the Butterfly Effect suggests everything you do today will change your future drastically. Skills you learned today could come in handy in ways you could never expect 10 years from now. Just like the fractals we talked about one small random action can have serious implications down the road.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Immune System 😷 免疫系统","slug":"2021-01-19-10-07-immune-system","date":"2021-01-19T02:07:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:29:25.371Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/19/2021-01-19-10-07-immune-system/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/19/2021-01-19-10-07-immune-system/","excerpt":"The immune system is a network of biological processes that protects an organism from diseases.

Many species have two major subsystems of the immune system. The innate immune system provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli. The adaptive immune system provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered. Both use molecules and cells to perform their functions. Nearly all organisms have some kind of immune system. Bacteria have a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against virus infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient plants and animals and remain in their modern descendants. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt to recognize pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. The immune system protects its host from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. Physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered. We live in a world filled with bacteria, viruses, and other deadly pathogens. In fact, many of them are trying to invade your body right now. If this thought makes you nervous, feel reassured that your body has its own Department of Defense - your immune system. This network works hard round the clock to protect you from harmful invaders. When a pathogen launches an attack, your immune system organizes a beautifully coordinated counter-attack to destroy the pathogen and keep you healthy. Unfortunately, your immune system can make mistakes, including: not destroying diseased or harmful cells (infections and cancer), reacting to non-harmful substances (allergies), or going rogue and attacking your own cells (autoimmune diseases). The immune system is fascinating and complex, and we want to share with you what’s going on in the field of immunology. When a virus enters your body, it will attach itself to one of your cells and inject its DNA or RNA into it. This is like a blueprint for your cells: containing instructions on what the cell has to make. So, in this case, the virus’s RNA will tell your cell to make more copies of the same virus. They become virus factories, pumping out new copies of the virus that can infect even more cells. Naturally, our bodies have a defense system for foreign intruders. The immune system attacks any protein, virus, or bacteria that do not belong in our bodies. But it takes a few days for it to learn how to attack the intruder. Meanwhile, the virus factories are running non-stop, quickly replicating the virus and spreading it in your body. In other words: you start experiencing symptoms of whatever has infected you. After a few days, however, your immune system has figured out how to attack the virus and will start to produce antibodies. These attach themselves to the virus, preventing them from infecting more cells and marking them for destruction. As you can see, the immune system is remarkable, but it’s also slow to mount an attack. That’s the reason why we get sick in the first place. So to give it a helping hand, we developed vaccines. The main idea is to train your immune system to recognize and fight off an infection before it has occurred. Almost like showing your immune system a mug shot of the virus and saying: “if you see this, kill it.” There are various types of vaccines, but let’s take a look at mRNA vaccines, the new kid on the block. To understand how they work, let’s take the COVID19 pandemic as an example. You might have seen pictures of the virus, with its distinctive spikes. These spikes allow the virus to attach to specific cells in your body (ACE2) and infect them. Now here’s the key idea for the COVID19 vaccine: what if we could train our immune system to recognize these spikes by having our body produce them? To do that, researchers took the virus’s blueprint, its RNA, and isolated the part responsible for producing the spikes. Armed with this blueprint, they created mRNA or messenger RNA. This is a special form of RNA that can enter your cells and give them instructions. In this case, the RNA contains instructions to build the spikes of the coronavirus, not the virus itself, just the spikes. So mRNA vaccines contain instructions for your cells that tell them to build a part of a virus in large volumes, almost like giving them a recipe to follow. Once this is happening, your immune system kicks into action and start learning how to attack these intruders. Again, it takes time for the immune system to fight off these spikes, but you won’t get sick because it’s only the spikes, not the virus itself. And that’s it! Your immune system has learned how to attack the spikes of the coronavirus. It destroys all the spikes and even breaks down the mRNA vaccine itself. The only thing left in your body are special “B cells” or memory cells. These can linger around for months or years until the same virus infects you again. When that happens, the B cell can produce the correct antibodies right away, preventing the virus from spreading and making you sick. What’s interesting about this mRNA technique is that it’s relatively quick to develop a vaccine as soon as we know the DNA or RNA sequence of a virus. And secondly, because the vaccine only makes our body produce a part of a virus, we can’t get sick. More traditional vaccines use weakened versions of the actual virus. This also triggers an immune response but could also give you mild symptoms. Now you know how mRNA vaccines work, what about their safety? The biggest misunderstanding about this technology is that the mRNA in the vaccine can enter our cells and changes our very own DNA. But that’s not true. mRNA is very fragile and only survives a few hours in our bodies.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Biology 生物学","slug":"Biology-生物学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Biology-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Respiratory System 😮‍💨 呼吸系统","slug":"2021-01-16-13-22-respiratory-system","date":"2021-01-16T05:22:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:30:11.354Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/16/2021-01-16-13-22-respiratory-system/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/16/2021-01-16-13-22-respiratory-system/","excerpt":"The respiratory system is the organs and other parts of your body involved in breathing,when you exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.","text":"The respiratory system is the organs and other parts of your body involved in breathing,when you exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.

This theory states that if these five elements are changed or moved, this could seriously affect a person’s fate. The “five elements” (五行) are also known as the five agents, five phases, five movements, five forces, five processes, and five planets. If the concept of yīn and yáng is the center of the Chinese culture, then the theory of the “five elements” should be treated as its cornerstone. The Five Elements TheoryThe five elements are metal (金), wood (木), water (水), fire (火), and earth (土). Chinese people use this five elements theory for a lot of things, from the interaction between internal organs to politics, and Chinese medicine to cooking and food. It’s just like finding the perfect balance yīn and yáng, it’s about trying to find the perfect balance between the five elements. There are two main relationships between these five elements. One is called “mutual generation (相生)” and the other one is called “mutual overcoming (相克).” Examples of mutual generating: Wood made Fire stronger. Fire made Earth (ash). Earth contained and bore Metal. Metal improved the quality of the Water. Water helps the Wood grow. Example of mutual overcoming: Earth can stop Water. Water can stop a Fire. Fire can melt Metal. Metal can cut Wood. Wood can consume Earth. To give an example from nature, a plant (wood) grows when it is given water. When burnt, wood gives birth to fire, and the burnt ashes subsequently return to the earth.

Wǔxíng originally refers to the five major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, Venus) that create five dimensions of earth life. Wǔxíng is also widely translated as “Five Elements” and this is used extensively by many including practitioners of Five Element acupuncture. The Chinese xíng (行) are “primarily concerned with process and change,” hence the common translation as “phases” or “agents”. By the same token, Mù (木) is thought of as “Tree” rather than “Wood”. The word element is thus used within the context of Chinese medicine with a different meaning to its usual meaning. It should be recognized that the word phase, although commonly preferred, is not perfect. Phase is a better translation for the five seasons (五運 wǔyùn) mentioned below, and so agents or processes might be preferred for the primary term xíng. Manfred Porkert attempts to resolve this by using Evolutive Phase for 五行 wǔxíng and Circuit Phase for 五運 wǔyùn, but these terms are unwieldy. Within Chinese medicine texts the wǔxíng are also referred to as wǔyùn (五運) or a combination of the two characters (五行運 wǔxíngyùn) these emphasise the correspondence of five elements to five ‘seasons’ (four seasons plus one). Another tradition refers to the wǔxíng as wǔdé (五德), the Five Virtues.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Chinese 国学","slug":"Chinese-国学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Chinese-%E5%9B%BD%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Predict Failure 🛟 预测失效","slug":"2021-01-11-11-37-predict-failure","date":"2021-01-11T03:37:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:32:40.871Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/11/2021-01-11-11-37-predict-failure/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/11/2021-01-11-11-37-predict-failure/","excerpt":"Maximum Normal Stress CriterionThe maximum stress criterion, also known as the normal stress, Coulomb, or Rankine criterion, is often used to predict the failure of brittle materials.","text":"Maximum Normal Stress CriterionThe maximum stress criterion, also known as the normal stress, Coulomb, or Rankine criterion, is often used to predict the failure of brittle materials. The maximum stress criterion states that failure occurs when the maximum (normal) principal stress reaches either the uniaxial tension strength st, or the uniaxial compression strength sc, $$-s_{c} \\lt { s_{1}, s_{2} } \\lt s_{t}$$ where $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are the principal stresses for 2D stress. Graphically, the maximum stress criterion requires that the two principal stresses lie within the green zone depicted below, Mohr’s TheoryThe Mohr Theory of Failure, also known as the Coulomb-Mohr criterion or internal-friction theory, is based on the famous Mohr’s Circle. Mohr’s theory is often used in predicting the failure of brittle materials, and is applied to cases of 2D stress. Mohr’s theory suggests that failure occurs when Mohr’s Circle at a point in the body exceeds the envelope created by the two Mohr’s circles for uniaxial tensile strength and uniaxial compression strength. This envelope is shown in the figure below, The left circle is for uniaxial compression at the limiting compression stress sc of the material. Likewise, the right circle is for uniaxial tension at the limiting tension stress st. The middle Mohr’s Circle on the figure (dash-dot-dash line) represents the maximum allowable stress for an intermediate stress state. All intermediate stress states fall into one of the four categories in the following table. Each case defines the maximum allowable values for the two principal stresses to avoid failure. Graphically, Mohr’s theory requires that the two principal stresses lie within the green zone depicted below, Also shown on the figure is the maximum stress criterion (dashed line). This theory is less conservative than Mohr’s theory since it lies outside Mohr’s boundary. We know that when we apply loads to an object, like this bracket, if we keep increasing the magnitude of the load, at some point the material will fail. But how can we predict when static failure will occur? What level do the stresses in the object need to reach for it to fail? First we need to define what failure is. For ductile materials failure is usually considered to occur at the onset of plastic deformation. And for brittle materials it occurs at fracture. These points are easy to define for a uniaxial stress state, like a tensile test. They occur when the normal stress in the object reaches the yield strength of the material for ductile materials and the ultimate strength for brittle materials. But for a more complex case of tri-axial stress, predicting failure is much less straightforward. In fact it’s so difficult to predict that we don’t have one universally applicable method. Instead, we have to predict failure by selecting the most suitable one of a range of different failure theories, each of which we know works relatively well under certain circumstances, based on experimentation. Because they fail in fundamentally different ways, failure theories which apply for ductile materials usually aren’t applicable for brittle materials, and vice-versa. So what does a failure theory do? It’s quite simple - it allows us to predict failure of a material by comparing the stress state in the object we are assessing with material properties that are easy to determine, like the yield or ultimate strengths of the material, that we can obtain by performing a uniaxial test. The stress state at a point can be described using the three principal stresses, so most failure theories are defined as a function of the principal stresses and the material strength. Probably the simplest failure theory is to say that failure occurs when the maximum or minimum principal stresses reach the yield or ultimate strengths of the material. This is called Maximum Principal Stress theory, or Rankine theory. Although it’s simple to apply, it’s not actually a great failure theory, particularly for ductile materials, for reasons I’ll explain later. Let’s look at some better failure theories for ductile materials. Any good failure theory needs to be consistent with experimental observations we can make about how materials fail. There is one key observation that failure theories for ductile materials need to capture, which is the fact that hydrostatic stresses do not cause yielding in ductile materials. Let me explain. A general tri-axial stress state like the one shown here can be decomposed into stresses which cause a change in volume, and stresses which cause shape distortion. Stresses that cause a change in volume are called hydrostatic stresses, because that is the type of stress acting on an object submerged in liquid. For a hydrostatic stress configuration the three principal stresses are always equal, and there are no shear stresses. For a tri-axial stress state we can calculate the hydrostatic component as the average of the three principal stresses. The mechanism that causes yielding of ductile materials is shear deformation. Since there are no shear stresses for a state of hydrostatic stress, this component can be very large and still not contribute to yielding. Yielding is only caused by the stresses which cause shape distortion. These are called deviatoric stresses. The deviatoric component is calculated by subtracting the hydrostatic component from each of the principal stresses. The hydrostatic and deviatoric components can be expressed in matrix form, like this. Here we have described the stress state using the principal stresses, but we could also describe it for an arbitrary orientation of the stress element. It can be helpful to use Mohr’s circle to understand the hydrostatic and deviatoric components of a tri-axial stress state. For a hydrostatic stress configuration there are no shear stresses, and so Mohr’s circle reduces to a single point, equal to the average of the three principal stresses. Shifting Mohr’s circle horizontally represents an increase in the hydrostatic component. And increasing the radius of Mohr’s circle without changing the average stress represents an increase in the deviatoric component. Since failure of ductile materials only depends on the deviatoric component, a good failure theory for ductile materials should produce the same result regardless of where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. This explains why Maximum Principal Stress theory is not a good failure theory for ductile materials - it isn’t consistent with the observation that yielding is independent of hydrostatic stress. Two failure theories which are consistent with this observation are the Tresca and von Mises failure criteria. These are the two most commonly used failure theories for ductile materials. Let’s start with the Tresca failure criterion, which is also called the maximum shear stress theory. It is named after the French engineer Henri Tresca, and it states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress is equal to the shear stress at yielding in a tensile test. This can be defined mathematically, like this. And graphically using Mohr’s circle, like this. This theory is consistent with the observation that hydrostatic stresses don’t affect yield. It doesn’t care where Mohr’s circle is located on the horizontal axis. It’s common to express this theory as a function of the principal stresses, instead of as a function of the shear stresses. We can see based on Mohr’s circle for a tri-axial stress state that the maximum shear stress is equal to the radius of the outer circle, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses, divided by 2. Mohr’s circle for a uniaxial tensile test at yielding looks like this. The intermediate and minimum principal stresses 𝞼₂ and 𝞼₃ are equal to zero, and the maximum principal stress 𝞼₁ is equal to the yield strength of the material. The shear stress at yielding is equal to half of the yield strength of the material, so we can re-write our equation to obtain the standard formulation for the Tresca theory. Let’s look at the von Mises failure criterion next, which is also called the maximum distortion energy theory. It was initially developed by the Austrian scientist Richard von Mises, but a number of others were involved in refining it, so it is sometimes called the Maxwell–Huber–Hencky–von Mises theory. It states that yielding occurs when the maximum distortion energy in a material is equal to the distortion energy at yielding in a uniaxial tensile test. So what is the distortion energy? It is essentially the portion of strain energy in a stressed element corresponding to the effect of the deviatoric stresses. The distortion energy per unit volume can be calculated from the principal stresses using this equation. We know that at yielding during a tensile test the maximum principal stress is equal to the yield strength of the material, and the two other principal stresses are equal to zero. So we can calculate the distortion energy at yielding in a tensile test by plugging in the appropriate principal stress values. And by equating the distortion energy at yielding with the general equation for a tri-axial stress state, and re-arranging a bit, we get an equation that defines the von Mises failure criterion. Again we can see that this theory considers the difference between principal stresses, and so is independent of the hydrostatic stress. The term on the left is often called the equivalent von Mises stress. If it is larger than the yield strength of the material, yielding is predicted to have occurred. The equivalent von Mises stress is a common output from stress analysis performed using the finite element method. Contour plots are typically generated to show the distribution of the von Mises equivalent stress within a component, as these allow areas at risk of yielding to be identified. When comparing failure theories it can be useful to plot their yield surfaces. A yield surface is the representation of a failure theory in the principal stress space, which sounds more complicated than it actually is. To keep things simple let’s start by considering a plane stress case, where one of the three principal stresses is equal to zero. By convention principal stresses are ordered from largest to smallest, like this, but since we don’t know yet how the stresses will be ordered, I’ll refer to them as 𝞼A, 𝞼B, and 𝞼C instead. We’ll say that 𝞼C is equal to zero, and so the two axes of our yield surface graph correspond to the two non-zero principal stresses, 𝞼A and 𝞼B. The yield surface for the Maximum Principal Stress theory is easy to plot - it says that yielding begins when either of these principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material, so it looks like this. Yielding is considered to have occurred when the stress state reaches this line. Next let’s plot the yield surface for the Tresca theory. This theory states that yielding occurs when the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses is equal to the yield strength of the material. But it’s not as simple as taking the difference between 𝞼A and 𝞼B. Plane stress is still a three-dimensional stress state. In the top right quadrant of the graph both 𝞼A and 𝞼B are positive, and so 𝞼C, which is equal to zero, is the minimum principal stress. The yield surface looks like this. But in the bottom right quadrant 𝞼B is negative, and so 𝞼B is the minimum principal stress. That gives us a yield surface that looks like this. Repeating this process for the other two quadrants completes the Tresca yield surface. von Mises yield theory for plane stress conditions is defined using this equation when expressed in terms of the principal stresses. We can square both sides of the equation and see that it is of the same form as an ellipse, which gives us the von Mises yield surface. Let’s plot some experimental data for tests performed on ductile materials and see how each of these theories compares. It’s clear that the Maximum Principal Stress theory has large areas where its use is potentially unsafe. So let’s get rid of it, and compare Tresca and von Mises. Both agree well with experimental observations, although von Mises agrees slightly better. The Tresca yield surface lies entirely inside the von Mises surface, meaning that Tresca is more conservative. If we assume that the principal stresses will increase in proportion to one another as a load is applied, and so the stress paths are straight lines, the difference between the Tresca and von Mises theories is largest for these three configurations. The maximum difference between the two theories can be calculated to be 15.5%. von Mises is usually preferred to Tresca because it agrees better with experimental data, but Tresca is sometimes used because it is easier to apply and it is more conservative. So far we have looked at a plane stress case, with 𝞼C equal to zero. But for a general three-dimensional stress state, 𝞼C will be non-zero. We know that the Tresca and von Mises yield surfaces aren’t affected by hydrostatic stresses, and so to obtain the yield surfaces in three dimensions we just need to extend the plane stress yield surfaces along the hydrostatic axis. Failure of brittle materials is different to failure of ductile materials. For brittle materials, failure is considered to occur by fracture rather than yielding. And unlike ductile materials, brittle materials tend to have compressive strengths that are much larger than their tensile strengths. This needs to be captured in any failure theory for brittle materials. It also means that to assess failure of brittle materials we need to know two separate ultimate strengths, for tension and for compression. Coulomb-Mohr theory is a failure theory often used for brittle materials. Unlike the theories we have seen for ductile materials, it considers failure to be sensitive to hydrostatic stresses, and captures the difference between tensile and compressive ultimate strengths. The easiest way to define this theory is using Mohr’s circle. We start by drawing the Mohr’s circles corresponding to failure in the uniaxial tensile and compressive tests. By drawing lines tangent to both circles we create a failure envelope. Coulomb-Mohr theory states that a material will fail for a stress-state with a Mohr’s circle that reaches this envelope. The Tresca yield criterion we saw earlier is actually a special case of the Coulomb-Mohr failure theory, where we have the same material properties in tension and in compression. The plane stress failure surface for Coulomb-Mohr theory looks like this. As you can see it doesn’t agree particularly well with experimental data in the bottom right quadrant. Modified Mohr theory is a slight variation on the theory, which better fits experimental data. It is one of the preferred general failure theories for brittle materials. Because failure theories for brittle materials need to account for the effect of hydrostatic stresses, these failure theories converge to a point when extended along the hydrostatic axis. And that’s it for this introduction to failure theories! We’ve covered the most common theories, but there are many more out there which may be more appropriate for specific scenarios.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Riemann Hypothesis 🎓 黎曼猜想","slug":"2021-01-07-06-23-riemann-hypothesis","date":"2021-01-06T22:23:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:33:12.254Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/07/2021-01-07-06-23-riemann-hypothesis/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/07/2021-01-07-06-23-riemann-hypothesis/","excerpt":"Riemann hypothesis, in number theory, hypothesis by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann concerning the location of solutions to the Riemann zeta function, which is connected to the prime number theorem and has important implications for the distribution of prime numbers.

Riemann included the hypothesis in a paper, “Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse” (“On the Number of Prime Numbers Less Than a Given Quantity”), published in the November 1859 edition of Monatsberichte der Berliner Akademie (“Monthly Review of the Berlin Academy”). Other than the “trivial zeros” along the negative real axis, all the solutions to the Riemann zeta function must lie in the critical strip of complex numbers whose real part is between 0 and 1. The Riemann hypothesis is that all these nontrivial zeros actually lie on the critical line, or $Re(S) &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$. The zeta function is defined as the infinite series $$\\zeta(s)&#x3D;1+2^{-s}+3^{-s}+4^{-s}+\\cdots$$ or, in more compact notation, $$\\zeta(s)&#x3D;\\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{s}}$$ where the summation $(Σ)$ of terms for n runs from 1 to infinity through the positive integers and s is a fixed positive integer greater than 1. The zeta function was first studied by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. (For this reason, it is sometimes called the Euler zeta function. For $ζ(1)$, this series is simply the harmonic series, known since antiquity to increase without bound — i.e., its sum is infinite.) Euler achieved instant fame when he proved in 1735 that $ζ(2) &#x3D; π^{2}&#x2F;6$, a problem that had eluded the greatest mathematicians of the era, including the Swiss Bernoulli family (Jakob, Johann, and Daniel). More generally, Euler discovered (1739) a relation between the value of the zeta function for even integers and the Bernoulli numbers, which are the coefficients in the Taylor series expansion of $x&#x2F;(e^{x} − 1)$. (See also exponential function.) Still more amazing, in 1737 Euler discovered a formula relating the zeta function, which involves summing an infinite sequence of terms containing the positive integers, and an infinite product that involves every prime number: $$\\zeta(s)&#x3D;\\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{s}}&#x3D;\\prod_{p} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$ Riemann extended the study of the zeta function to include the complex numbers $x + iy$, where $i &#x3D; \\sqrt{−1}$, except for the line $x &#x3D; 1$ in the complex plane. Riemann knew that the zeta function equals zero for all negative even integers −2, −4, −6, … (so-called trivial zeros) and that it has an infinite number of zeros in the critical strip of complex numbers that fall strictly between the lines $x &#x3D; 0$ and $x &#x3D; 1$. He also knew that all nontrivial zeros are symmetric with respect to the critical line $x &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$. Riemann conjectured that all of the nontrivial zeros are on the critical line, a conjecture that subsequently became known as the Riemann hypothesis. In 1914 English mathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy proved that an infinite number of solutions of $ζ(s) &#x3D; 0$ exist on the critical line $x &#x3D; 1&#x2F;2$. Subsequently it was shown by various mathematicians that a large proportion of the solutions must lie on the critical line, though the frequent “proofs” that all the nontrivial solutions are on it have been flawed. Computers have also been used to test solutions, with the first 10 trillion nontrivial solutions shown to lie on the critical line. A proof of the Riemann hypothesis would have far-reaching consequences for number theory and for the use of primes in cryptography. The Riemann hypothesis has long been considered the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics. It was one of 10 unsolved mathematical problems (23 in the printed address) presented as a challenge for 20th-century mathematicians by German mathematician David Hilbert at the Second International Congress of Mathematics in Paris on Aug. 8, 1900. In 2000 American mathematician Stephen Smale updated Hilbert’s idea with a list of important problems for the 21st century; the Riemann hypothesis was number one.In 2000 it was designated a Millennium Problem, one of seven mathematical problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., U.S., for a special award. The solution for each Millennium Problem is worth $1 million.In 2008 the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) listed it as one of the DARPA Mathematical Challenges, 23 mathematical problems for which it was soliciting research proposals for funding — “Mathematical Challenge Nineteen: Settle the Riemann Hypothesis.

In particular, if the amount of fluid flowing into $P$ is the same as the amount flowing out, then the divergence at $P$ is zero. Definition: divergence in $\\mathbb{R}^3$If $\\vec{F} &#x3D; \\langle P,Q,R \\rangle$ is a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $P_x, , Q_y,$ and $R_z$ all exist, then the divergence of $\\vec{F}$ is defined by $$\\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{div} F &amp;&#x3D;P_{x}+Q_{y}+R_{z} \\&amp;&#x3D;\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial z}\\end{aligned}$$ Note the divergence of a vector field is not a vector field, but a scalar function. In terms of the gradient operator $$\\vec{\\nabla}&#x3D;\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right\\rangle$$ divergence can be written symbolically as the dot product $$\\operatorname{div} \\vec{F}&#x3D;\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\vec{F}.$$ Note this is merely helpful notation, because the dot product of a vector of operators and a vector of functions is not meaningfully defined given our current definition of dot product. If $\\vec{F} &#x3D; \\langle P,Q \\rangle$ is a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ , and $P_{x}$ and $Q_{y}$ both exist, then the divergence of $\\vec{F}$ is defined similarly as $$\\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{div} \\vec{F} &amp;&#x3D;P_{x}+Q_{y} \\&amp;&#x3D;\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y} \\&amp;&#x3D;\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\vec{F}\\end{aligned}.$$ To illustrate this point, consider the two vector fields in Figure 1. At any particular point, the amount flowing in is the same as the amount flowing out, so at every point the “outflowing-ness” of the field is zero. Therefore, we expect the divergence of both fields to be zero, and this is indeed the case, as $$\\text{div}(\\langle 1,2 \\rangle ) &#x3D; \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (1) + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2) &#x3D; 0$$ and $$\\text{div}(\\langle -y,x \\rangle ) &#x3D; \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (-y) + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x) &#x3D; 0.$$ Figure 1: (a) Vector field ⟨1, 2⟩ has zero divergence. (b) Vector field ⟨−𝑦, 𝑥⟩ also has zero divergence. By contrast, consider radial vector field $\\vec{R}(x, y)&#x3D;\\langle-x,-y\\rangle$ in Figure 2. At any given point, more fluid is flowing in than is flowing out, and therefore the “outgoingness” of the field is negative. We expect the divergence of this field to be negative, and this is indeed the case, as $$\\operatorname{div}(\\vec{R})&#x3D;\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-x)+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-y)&#x3D;-2$$ Figure 2: This vector field has negative divergence. To get a global sense of what divergence is telling us, suppose that a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ represents the velocity of a fluid. Imagine taking an elastic circle (a circle with a shape that can be changed by the vector field) and dropping it into a fluid. If the circle maintains its exact area as it flows through the fluid, then the divergence is zero. This would occur for both vector fields in Figure 1. On the other hand, if the circle’s shape is distorted so that its area shrinks or expands, then the divergence is not zero. Imagine dropping such an elastic circle into the radial vector field in Figure 2 so that the center of the circle lands at point (3, 3). The circle would flow toward the origin, and as it did so the front of the circle would travel more slowly than the back, causing the circle to “scrunch” and lose area. This is how you can see a negative divergence. CurlThe second operation on a vector field that we examine is the curl, which measures the extent of rotation of the field about a point. Suppose that $\\vec{F}$ represents the velocity field of a fluid. Then, the curl of $\\vec{F}$ at point $P$ is a vector that measures the tendency of particles near $P$ to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of this vector. The magnitude of the curl vector at $P$ measures how quickly the particles rotate around this axis. In other words, the curl at a point is a measure of the vector field’s “spin” at that point. Visually, imagine placing a paddlewheel into a fluid at $P$ , with the axis of the paddlewheel aligned with the curl vector (Figure 3). The curl measures the tendency of the paddlewheel to rotate. Figure 3: To visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a small paddlewheel into the vector field at a point. Consider the vector fields in Figure 1. In part (a), the vector field is constant and there is no spin at any point. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be zero, and this is indeed the case. Part (b) shows a rotational field, so the field has spin. In particular, if you place a paddlewheel into a field at any point so that the axis of the wheel is perpendicular to a plane, the wheel rotates counterclockwise. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be nonzero, and this is indeed the case (the curl is $2,\\mathbf{\\hat k}$). To see what curl is measuring globally, imagine dropping a leaf into the fluid. As the leaf moves along with the fluid flow, the curl measures the tendency of the leaf to rotate. If the curl is zero, then the leaf doesn’t rotate as it moves through the fluid. Definition: CurlIf $\\vec{F} &#x3D; \\langle P,Q,R \\rangle$ is a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $P_x, , Q_y,$ and $R_z$ all exist, then the curl of $\\vec{F}$ is defined by $$\\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{curl} \\vec{F} &amp;&#x3D;\\left(\\boldsymbol{R}{y}-Q{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}+\\left(\\boldsymbol{P}{z}-\\boldsymbol{R}{x}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(Q_{x}-\\boldsymbol{P}_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\&amp;&#x3D;\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{R}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{y}}-\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{P}}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{R}}{\\partial x}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{P}}{\\partial y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\end{aligned}$$ Note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field, in contrast to divergence. The definition of curl can be difficult to remember. To help with remembering, we use the notation $\\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\vec{F}$ to stand for a “determinant” that gives the curl formula: $$\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}\\hat{i} &amp; \\hat{j} &amp; \\hat{k} \\\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} &amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\P &amp; Q &amp; R\\end{array}\\right|.$$ The determinant of this matrix is $$\\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}-\\left(R_{x}-P_{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\\left(R_{y}-Q_{z}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}+\\left(P_{z}-R_{x}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}+\\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\\operatorname{curl} \\vec{F}.$$ Thus, this matrix is a way to help remember the formula for curl. Keep in mind, though, that the word determinant is used very loosely. A determinant is not really defined on a matrix with entries that are three vectors, three operators, and three functions. If $\\vec{F} &#x3D; \\langle P,Q \\rangle$ is a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ , then the curl of $\\vec{F}$ , by definition, is $$\\operatorname{curl} \\vec{F}&#x3D;\\left(Q_{x}-P_{y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}&#x3D;\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$$","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Antenna 📡 天线","slug":"2021-01-06-23-53-antenna","date":"2021-01-06T15:53:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T06:15:28.035Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-53-antenna/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-53-antenna/","excerpt":"Antennas are widely used in the field of telecommunications and we know many applications for them.

Antennas receive an electromagnetic wave and convert it to an electric signal, or receive an electric signal and radiate it as an electromagnetic wave. Yagi Uda antennaIn the past, dipole antennas were used for TV reception. Reflector elements (usually only one is used) are slightly longer than the driven dipole and placed behind the driven element, opposite the direction of intended transmission. Directors, on the other hand, are a little shorter and placed in front of the driven element in the intended direction. hese parasitic elements are typically off-tuned short-circuited dipole elements, that is, instead of a break at the feedpoint (like the driven element) a solid rod is used. They receive and reradiate the radio waves from the driven element but in a different phase determined by their exact lengths. Their effect is to modify the driven element’s radiation pattern. The waves from the multiple elements superpose and interfere to enhance radiation in a single direction, increasing the antenna’s gain in that direction. Also called a beam antenna and parasitic array, the Yagi is very widely used as a directional antenna on the HF, VHF and UHF bands. It has moderate to high gain of up to 20 dBi, depending on the number of elements used, and a front-to-back ratio of up to 20 dB. It radiates linearly polarized radio waves, and can be mounted for either horizontal or vertical polarization. It is relatively lightweight, inexpensive and simple to construct. The bandwidth of a Yagi antenna, the frequency range over which it maintains its gain and feedpoint impedance, is narrow, just a few percent of the center frequency, decreasing for models with higher gain, making it ideal for fixed-frequency applications. The largest and best-known use is as rooftop terrestrial television antennas, but it is also used for point-to-point fixed communication links, in radar antennas, and for long distance shortwave communication by shortwave broadcasting stations and radio amateurs. Satellite dish antenna Nowadays we have moved to dish TV antennas. These consist of two main components, a parabolic shaped reflector and a low noise block down converter. A satellite dish is a dish-shaped type of parabolic antenna designed to receive or transmit information by radio waves to or from a communication satellite. The term most commonly means a dish which receives direct-broadcast satellite television from a direct broadcast satellite in geostationary orbit. Microstrip antenna or Patch antennaThe cellphone in your hand uses a completely different type of antenna, called a patch antenna. These types of antennas are inexpensive and fabricated easily onto a printed circuit board. A patch antenna consists of a metallic patch or strip placed on a ground plane with a piece of dielectric material in-between. Here, the metallic patch acts as a radiating element. The length of the metal patch should be half of the wavelength for proper transmission and reception. A patch antenna is a type of antenna with a low profile, which can be mounted on a surface. It consists of a planar rectangular, circular, triangular, or any geometrical sheet or “patch” of metal, mounted over a larger sheet of metal called a ground plane. They are the original type of microstrip antenna described by Howell in 1972; the two metal sheets together form a resonant piece of microstrip transmission line with a length of approximately one-half wavelength of the radio waves. The radiation mechanism arises from fringing fields along the radiating edges. The radiation at the edges causes the antenna to act slightly larger electrically than its physical dimensions, so in order for the antenna to be resonant, a length of microstrip transmission line slightly shorter than one-half the wavelength at the frequency is used. The patch antenna is mainly practical at microwave frequencies, at which wavelengths are short enough that the patches are conveniently small. It is widely used in portable wireless devices because of the ease of fabricating it on printed circuit boards. Multiple patch antennas on the same substrate called microstrip antennas, can be used to make high gain array antennas, and phased arrays in which the beam can be electronically steered. A variant of the patch antenna commonly used in mobile phones is the shorted patch antenna, or planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA). In this antenna, one corner of the patch (or sometimes one edge) is grounded with a ground pin. This variant has better matching than the standard patch. Another variant of patch antenna with the partially etched ground plane, also known as printed monopole antenna, is a very versatile antenna for dual-band operations. Antennas receive an electromagnetic wave and convert it to an electric signal, or receive an electric signal and radiate it as an electromagnetic wave. We have an electric signal, so how do we convert it to an electromagnetic wave? You might have a simple answer in your mind. That is to use a closed conductor and with the help of the principle of electromagnetic induction, you will be able to produce a fluctuating magnetic field and an electric field around it. However, this fluctuating field around the source is of no use in transmitting signals. The electromagnetic field here does not propagate, instead, it just fluctuates around the source. In an antenna, the electromagnetic waves need to be separated from the source and they should propagate. Before looking at how an antenna is made, let’s understand the physics behind the wave separation. Consider one positive and one negative charge placed a distance apart. This arrangement is known as a dipole, and they obviously produce an electric field as shown. Now, assume that these charges are oscillating as shown, at the midpoint of their path, the velocity will be at the maximum and at the ends of their paths the velocity will be zero. The charged particles undergo continuous acceleration and deceleration due to this velocity variation. The challenge now is to find out how the electric field varies due to this movement. Let’s concentrate on only one electric field line. The wavefront formed at time zero expands and is deformed as shown after one eighth of a time period. This is surprising. You might’ve expected a simple electric field as shown at this location. Why has the electric field stretched and formed a field like this? This is because the accelerating or decelerating charges produce an electric field with some memory effects. The old electric field does not easily adjust to the new condition. We need to spend some time to understand this memory effect of the electric field or kink generation of accelerating or decelerating charges. We will discuss this interesting topic in more detail in a separate video. If we continue our analysis in the same manner, we can see that at one quarter of a time period, the wavefront ends meet at a single point. After this, the separation and propagation of the Wavefront happens. Please note that this varying electric field will automatically generate a varying magnetic field perpendicular to it. If you draw electric field intensity variation with the distance, you can see that the wave propagation is sinusoidal in nature. It is interesting to note that the wavelength of the propagation so produced is exactly double that of the length of the dipole. We will come back to this point later. This is exactly what we need in an antenna. In short, we can make an antenna if we can make an arrangement for oscillating the positive and negative charges. In practice, the production of such an oscillating charge, is very easy. Take a conducting rod with a bend in its center, and apply a voltage signal at the center. Assume this is the signal you have applied, a time-varying voltage signal. Consider the case at time zero. Due to the effect of the voltage, the electrons will be displaced from the right of the dipole and will be accumulated on the left. This means the other end which has lost electrons automatically becomes positively charged. This arrangement has created the same effect as the previous dipole charge case, that is positive and negative charges at the end of a wire. With the variation of voltage with time, the positive and negative charges will shuttle to and fro. The simple dipole antenna also produces the same phenomenon we saw in the previous section and wave propagation occurs. We have now seen how the antenna works as a transmitter. The frequency of the transmitted signal will be the same as the frequency of the applied voltage signal. Since the propagation travels at the speed of light, we can easily calculate the wavelength of the propagation. For perfect transmission, the length of the antenna should be half of the wavelength. The operation of the antenna is reversible and it can work as a receiver if a propagating electromagnetic field hits it. Let’s see this phenomenon in detail. Take the same antenna again and apply an electric field. At this instant, the electrons will accumulate at one end of the rod. This is the same as an electric dipole. As the applied electric field varies, the positive and negative charges accumulate at the other ends. The varying charge accumulation means a varying electric voltage signal is produced at the center of the antenna. This voltage signal is the output when the antenna works as a receiver. The frequency of the output voltage signal is the same as the frequency of the receiving EM wave. It is clear from the electric field configuration that for perfect reception, the size of the antenna should be half of the wavelength. In all these discussions, we have seen that the antenna is an open circuit. Now let’s see a few practical antennas and how they work. In the past, dipole antennas were used for TV reception. The colored bar acts as a dipole and receives the signal. A reflector and director are also needed in this kind of antenna to focus the signal on the dipole. This complete structure is known as a Yagi-Uda antenna. The dipole antenna converted the received signal into electrical signals, and these electrical signals were carried by coaxial cable to the television unit. Nowadays we have moved to dish TV antennas. These consists of two main components, a parabolic shaped reflector and the low-noise block downconverter. The parabolic dish receives electromagnetic signals from the satellite and focuses them onto the LNBF. The shape of the parabolic is very specifically and accurately designed. The LNBF is made up of a feedhorn, a waveguide, a PCB, and a probe. In this animation, you can see how the incoming signals are focused onto the probe via the feedhorn and waveguide. At the probe, voltage is induced as we saw in the simple dipole case. The voltage signal so generated is fed to a PCB for signal processing such as filtration, conversion from high to low frequency and amplification. After signal processing, these electrical signals are carried down to the television unit through a coaxial cable. If you open up an LNB, you will most probably find two probes instead of one. The second probe being perpendicular to the first one. The two probe arrangement means the available spectrum can be used twice by sending the waves with either horizontal or vertical polarization. One probe detects the horizontally polarized signal and the other, the vertically polarized signal. The cell phone in your hand uses a completely different type of antenna called a patch antenna. A patch antenna consists of a metallic patch or strip placed on a ground plane with a piece of dielectric material in between. Here, the metallic patch acts as a radiating element. The length of the metal patch should be half of the wavelength for proper transmission and reception.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Electromagnetic Radiation ☣️ 电磁辐射","slug":"2021-01-06-23-43-electromagnetic-radiation","date":"2021-01-06T15:43:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:35:25.714Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-43-electromagnetic-radiation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/06/2021-01-06-23-43-electromagnetic-radiation/","excerpt":"In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space, carrying electromagnetic radiant energy.

It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. In the modern world, we humans are completely surrounded by electromagnetic radiation. Have you ever thought of the physics behind these traveling electromagnetic waves? The great scientist, Heinrich Hertz, was the first man to transmit and detect electromagnetic waves. In his famous experiment, a high voltage current was applied to the two ends of two metal wires, which generated a spark in the gap between them. This spark resulted in the radiation of electromagnetic waves. Those electromagnetic waves traveled through the air and created a spark in a metal coil located over a meter away. If you had placed an LED in that gap, the bulb would have glowed. This was a clear case of electromagnetic wave propagation and detection. However, before Hertz, the brilliant mathematician, James clerk Maxwell, had already laid out the foundations for electromagnetic radiation by formulating for mathematical equations. However, these equations and the Hertz experiment raised a question, how do electromagnetic fields detach themselves from wires and propagate through a space? More specifically, what we need is a traveling electromagnetic wave and not a fluctuating one. Let’s explore this logically. Consider an electric charge, which is moving at a constant speed. The electric field around it is shown. Now imagine for a fraction of a second it accelerates after that, it continues its uniform motion at a higher speed. What we need to understand is the effect of this acceleration on the electric field. The interesting thing is that the information does not travel at an infinite speed, instead, it travels at the speed of light. Similarly, the information about the sudden variation of velocity of the charge does not get conveyed to the whole electric field region. The field near it knows about it, but the field far away still has no idea that the charge has accelerated and it is still in the old state. Let’s separate out these regions with the help of two circles. Since the electric field cannot break the field between these distances must transition. This transition field is known as a kink. The kink moves or radiates outwards at the speed of light. To show the kink animation in a clear way, let’s move the camera along with the charge. We can say here that the acceleration of the charge has caused an electromagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic radiation. Based on this understanding, we will be able to understand the most important experiment in the field of antenna technology, the oscillating electric dipole. The interesting fact about this simple oscillating dipole is that it produces electromagnetic radiation in a perfectly sinusoidal manner. Let’s see how it is achieved. Before getting into the electromagnetics, let’s understand how velocity and acceleration vary in this simple case. It is clear that at both ends the velocities should be zero and in the middle the velocity should be at the maximum. This means that this is a case of continuous acceleration and deceleration. The electric field pattern is drawn here when the chargers are far apart, and when the velocity is zero. In order to have a better understanding, let’s examine one of the electric field lines. Let’s observe the electric field line at t by eight. You can see that the electric field line is deformed. The reason for this deformation is simple. This time period is the region with the highest acceleration. As we saw earlier, accelerating or decelerating charges cause kinks in the electric field. In short, the old electric field does not get adjusted to the new field very well. This deformation is continuous since there is continuous acceleration in the charge. When two charges meet at the central point, the deformed line also meets there. After that, it detaches and radiates. This radiation travels at the speed of light. If you applied an electric field intensity variation with respect to length, you can see that the radiation we have produced is perfectly sinusoidal in nature. Please note that this varying electric field will automatically generate a varying magnetic field perpendicular to it. Now let’s have a look at how this applies to an antenna. A time varying voltage is applied to the metal wire is shown due to the effect of the voltage the electrons will be displaced from right to left and create positive and negative charges. With a continuous variation of voltage, the positive and negative charges will shuttle back and forth in the wire. The simple arrangement is known as a dipole antenna. The dipole antenna produces the same radiation as we saw in the previous section. In this case, the antenna works as a transmitter. The frequency of the transmitted signal will be the same as the frequency of the applied voltage signal. The same antenna can act as a receiver if the operation of the antenna is reversed. When propagating electromagnetic waves strike the antenna, the oscillating fields of waves create positive and negative charges at the ends of the antenna. The varying charge accumulation means a varying voltage signal is produced at the center of the antenna. This voltage signal is the output when the antenna works as a receiver. We can note here that for perfect transmission or reception, the length of the antenna should be half of the wavelength. This is the first antenna design criteria for proper reception or transmission. The second most important design criteria is a term called impedance matching. Perfect impedance matching will make sure that the waves are radiated in the most efficient way. When an alternating current passes through a circuit, it faces opposition from the combined effects of resistance, inductance and capacitance. This combined effect is known as impedance. According to the maximum power transfer theorem, to transfer the maximum amount of power the load impedance should match with the source impedance. For further understanding, let’s take an example of a circuit containing an alternator as a source and a motor bulb, et cetera, as a load. In this setup to achieve maximum power transfer from alternator to the load, the impedance of the load must match with the impedance of the alternator. A similar impedance balance is required in the case of an antenna system. Since an antenna works on high frequency signals, the impedance of the transmission lines also becomes important. Hence to achieve maximum power, the impedance of an antenna should match to the impedance of the source and transmission line as well. If the impedances do not match, some portion of the power would be reflected back to the source instead of radiating outwards from the antenna. A free space has an impedance value of 377 ohms. In a parabolic antenna, a wave guide is used as a transmission line, which has a different impedance value from the free space. That’s why a feedhorn is also included in a parabolic antenna. This way, the impedance of the wave guide is matched with the impedance of the free space so that the EM waves can be received properly.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Colored Pencils 🖍️ 彩铅","slug":"2021-01-04-03-04-colored-pencils","date":"2021-01-03T19:04:00.000Z","updated":"2022-12-15T14:12:32.587Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/01/04/2021-01-04-03-04-colored-pencils/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2021/01/04/2021-01-04-03-04-colored-pencils/","excerpt":"There’s a lot to like about drawing with colored pencils.

They’re utterly convenient—a handful of colored pencils and a pad of paper are all you really need to start creating. Prep time and cleanup are practically non-issues, the materials are light and portable, and you don’t need messy or toxic solvents. At the same time, colored pencil drawing lends itself to highly refined and exquisite works of art that rival those created with any other medium. Colored pencils are relatively inexpensive, and the palette is extensive. The color is pure, clean and bright. The medium is permanent, and colored pencil drawings do not require elaborate care or storage. Along with hard and soft colored pencils, watercolor pencils and oil-based colored pencils offer more options for beginning artists. Aside from their convenience and versatility, much of the appeal of colored pencils is the control they offer. You can do loose work, tight work or anything in between. You can use colored pencil to tint a drawing with light strokes that let the color of the paper show through, or you can use colored pencil to create a solid deposit of many layers of color. Because colored pencil is primarily a dry medium, there’s no drying time to worry about. You can walk away from the work and come back and pick up right where you left off. You can start and stop at any time. Colored pencil offers the pleasures and rewards of both drawing and painting. Whatever other medium you enjoy, you’ll find colored pencil a worthwhile addition to your repertoire. Colored pencil offers the pleasures and rewards of both drawing and painting. Whatever other medium you enjoy, you’ll find colored pencil a worthwhile addition to your repertoire. Enjoy these colored pencil techniques &amp; tips, perfect for beginners or artists new to colored pencil drawing and painting. Shading: produced with an even, side-to-side stroke that creates a smooth even layer of color; a light touch will deposit a faint amount of color for graduated colored pencil shading. Hatching: a series of evenly spaced, parallel lines that leave a little white or color of the underlying surface visible; hatching in colored pencil adds texture to your compositions. Cross-hatching: hatching overlaid at an angle to build up layers of color or value; keep the pencil tips sharp to create fine, even lines. Burnishing: layers of colored pencil applied with strong, even pressure so the colors blend or intermix, completely covering the paper with a smooth solid color; a stump or tortillion or a smooth metal tool rubbed with even, heavy pressure in a circular motion against a deposit of color will also burnish the color. Burnish light-colored areas first. Blending: produced by applying heavy, even pressure with a pigmentless blending pencil or a white or light-colored pencil (such as cream or light gray), creating slick, evenly blended color; a stiff bristle brush can be used to blend colors as well. Colored pencil blending techniques can help add depth to your colored pencil drawings. Burnishing or blending with pale ochre creates an aged or antique look for metallic surfaces. Alternatively, you can use cloud blue to suggest atmospheric perspective. A colorless marker can also be used to blend layers of color together. Permanent markers are good for making washes or underpaintings in colored pencil drawings. Scumbling: an irregular or broken deposit of one color over another allowing the underlying color to be visible through the top layer. Solvent effects: using a solvent such as mineral spirits — applied with a cotton swab or brush — softens the colored pencil deposit and creates a wide range of interesting colored pencil effects. MUST-HAVE COLORED PENCIL TOOLS Colored Pencil Tools | Drawing with Colored PencilsGood sharpener: A good quality hand-held sharpener is a must; an electric sharpener saves time and energy. Colorless blender: A colored pencil with a core made of pigmentless wax can be used to blend colors or soften edges without adding more color. Erasers: White plastic erasers will remove or manipulate colored pencil marks; eraser pencils and sticks are useful for concise erasure. Eraser shields: This small, flat metal tool with openings of various shapes can be used for precise, controlled erasure. Cotton swabs: These can be used for burnishing or for applying solvents. Knives: Use these or other sharp instruments for sgraffito. Spray workable fixative: Use fixative to protect a finished drawing and prevent wax blooms. Sturdy storage box: Keep your pencils orderly and protected.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Painting 绘画","slug":"Painting-绘画","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Painting-%E7%BB%98%E7%94%BB/"}]},{"title":"Inception 💤 盗梦空间","slug":"2020-12-30-22-03-inception","date":"2020-12-30T14:03:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T03:05:56.456Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/30/2020-12-30-22-03-inception/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/30/2020-12-30-22-03-inception/","excerpt":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.","text":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.

The two sections of the weapon are commonly made out of wood, while the link is a cord or a metal chain. The nunchaku is most widely used in martial arts such as Okinawan kobudō and karate, and is used as a training weapon, since it allows the development of quicker hand movements and improves posture. Modern-day nunchaku can be made from metal, wood, plastic or fiberglass. Toy versions and replicas not intended to be used as weapons may be made of polystyrene foam or plastic. Possession of this weapon is illegal in some countries, except for use in professional martial arts schools. The origin of the nunchaku is unclear; a traditional explanation holds that it was originally used by Okinawan farmers as a flail for threshing rice. Another weapon, called the tabak-toyok, native to the northern Philippines, is constructed very similarly, suggesting that it and the nunchaku descended from the same instrument. In modern times, the nunchaku was popularized by the actor and martial artist Bruce Lee and by Dan Inosanto. Lee famously used nunchaku in several scenes in the 1972 film Fist of Fury. When Tadashi Yamashita worked with Bruce Lee on the 1973 film Enter the Dragon, he enabled Lee to further explore the use of the nunchaku and other kobudo disciplines. The nunchaku is also the signature weapon of the cartoon character Michelangelo in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise.

The depth and sheer number of brilliant ideas that went into it is just astounding it’s easy to miss the beauty aspect of the FFT since it’s often introduced in fairly complex settings that require a lot of prerequisite knowledge such as the discrete fourier transform time domain to frequency domain conversions and much more. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient $O(N \\log N)$ algorithm for calculating DFTs. The FFT exploits symmetries in the $W$ matrix to take a “divide and conquer” approach. We will first discuss deriving the actual FFT algorithm, some of its implications for the DFT, and a speed comparison to drive home the importance of this powerful algorithm. To derive the FFT, we assume that the signal’s duration is a power of two: $N&#x3D;2^l$ . Consider what happens to the even-numbered and odd-numbered elements of the sequence in the DFT calculation. $$\\begin{align}S(k) &amp;&#x3D;s(0)+s(2) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi 2 k}{N}}+\\ldots+s(N-2) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi(N-2) k}{N}}+s(1) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi k}{N}}+s(3) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi \\times (2+1) k}{N}}+\\ldots+s(N-1) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi(N-2+1) k}{N}} \\nonumber \\end{align}$$ $$\\begin{align}&amp;&#x3D;s(0)+s(2)e^{(-j)\\frac{2\\pi k}{\\frac{N}{2}}} + \\ldots + s(N-2)e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi\\left(\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right) k}{\\frac{N}{2}}} +\\left( s(1)+s(3) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi k}{\\frac{N}{2}}}+\\dots+s(N-1) e^{(-j) \\frac{2 \\pi\\left(\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right) k}{\\frac{N}{2}}}\\right) e^{\\frac{-(j 2 \\pi k)}{N}} \\end{align}$$ Each term in square brackets has the form of a $\\frac{N}{2}$ -length DFT. The first one is a DFT of the even-numbered elements, and the second of the odd-numbered elements. The first DFT is combined with the second multiplied by the complex exponential $e^{\\frac{-(j 2\\pi k)}{N}}$. The half-length transforms are each evaluated at frequency indices $k \\in{0, \\ldots, N-1}$. Normally, the number of frequency indices in a DFT calculation range between zero and the transform length minus one. The computational advantage of the FFT comes from recognizing the periodic nature of the discrete Fourier transform. The FFT simply reuses the computations made in the half-length transforms and combines them through additions and the multiplication by $e^{\\frac{-(j 2 \\pi k)}{N}}$, which is not periodic over $\\frac{N}{2}$, to rewrite the length-N DFT. The formula above illustrates this decomposition. As it stands, we now compute two length-$\\frac{N}{2}$ transforms (complexity $2 O\\left(\\frac{N^{2}}{4}\\right)$), multiply one of them by the complex exponential (complexity $O(N)$), and add the results (complexity $O(N)$). At this point, the total complexity is still dominated by the half-length DFT calculations, but the proportionality coefficient has been reduced. Now for the fun. Because $N&#x3D;2^l$, each of the half-length transforms can be reduced to two quarter-length transforms, each of these to two eighth-length ones, etc. This decomposition continues until we are left with length-2 transforms. This transform is quite simple, involving only additions. Thus, the first stage of the FFT has $\\frac{N}{2}$length-2 transforms (see the bottom part of fomula). Pairs of these transforms are combined by adding one to the other multiplied by a complex exponential. Each pair requires 4 additions and 4 multiplications, giving a total number of computations equaling $8\\frac{N}{4}&#x3D;\\frac{N}{2}$. This number of computations does not change from stage to stage. Because the number of stages, the number of times the length can be divided by two, equals $\\log_2 N$, the complexity of the FFT is $O(N \\log N)$. The initial decomposition of a length-8 DFT into the terms using even- and odd-indexed inputs marks the first phase of developing the FFT algorithm. When these half-length transforms are successively decomposed, we are left with the diagram shown in the bottom panel that depicts the length-8 FFT computation. 法国数学家傅里叶提出，任何周期函数都可表示为不同频率的正弦函数和，或余弦函数之和，其中每个正弦函数和，或余弦函数都要乘以不同的系数，这个和就称为傅里叶级数。 DFT 是指 Discrete Fourier Transform，离散傅里叶变换。 FFT 是指 快速傅里叶变换，它是 DFT 的一种简化计算。它是根据离散傅氏变换的奇、偶、虚、实等特性，对离散傅立叶变换的算法进行改进获得的。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Baduk 🧇 围棋

气：在棋盘上，棋子与它直线紧紧相邻的空交叉点，就是这个棋子的“气”。单独一个棋子的气数不超过四气，但两个或两个以上相连的棋子则可以有四气以上。棋子若失去所有的气，就成为死棋，不能在棋盘上存在。 目：棋盘上，被一方棋子所围地域的空白交叉点，称之为“目”。一个交叉点即是1目，目的数量称为“目数”。 空：用棋子围成的地域。 地：（1）即地域或空。指已为某方占有的地区。（2）形势判断用语。如“黑地六十目”，即指黑方可望在全局围有六十目的地域。（3）指占有子和“空”的总和。即棋子围有的全部交叉点。 活棋：所包围的目数和活棋本身之总和，称为“地”。 提子：将对方无气的棋子从棋盘上取下，称为“提子”。 打劫：双方可以轮流提取对方棋子的情况。围棋规则规定，打劫时，被提取的一方不能直接提回，必须在其他地方找劫材使对方应一手之后方可提回。 真眼：由几个连接在一起的棋子围住一个或两个空交叉点，则称该点为真眼，简称“眼”。 假眼：由几个没有完全连接的棋子围成了眼的形状，称为“假眼” 。在一定条件下，围成假眼的棋子会被对方吃掉。 活棋：棋盘上凡是对方无法提取的棋即是活棋。活棋通常要具备两只真眼。 死棋：棋盘上迟早能被对方提取的棋，即为死棋。死棋不具有两只真眼。 公活：双方互围的棋子均无两只眼，但又不能制杀对方时即为公活，也称“双活”。 禁着点：棋盘任一点，一方下子后，该棋子即呈无气状态，同时又不能提取对方的棋子，这个点就称为该方的“禁着点”。一方不能下子的禁着点，对方可以下子。 布局：布局是一盘棋的先导，也是双方进行阵容部署、各自抢占要点，为双方接触作战作准备的阶段。 定式：是指布局阶段双方在角部的争夺中，按照一定的行棋次序，选择比较合理的着法，最终形成双方大体安定、利益大体均等的棋本棋形。定式的种类有星定式、小目定式、三三定式、目外定式、高目定式等。 中盘：也称为中局，指双方在布局之后从短兵相接开始进行的全局性作战阶段。 收官：是指中盘作战基本结束，双方所占地域已经大致确定，进而使双方属地完全明确的一系列着法。 位置 星：在棋盘坐标4·四的位置和棋盘正中央标有九个小圆点，术语称为“星”。这九颗星，将棋盘大致划分为左上角、右上角、左下角、右下角、上边、下边、左边、右边和中腹九个区域。 角：指棋盘四个角部星位内侧的区域。 边：指棋盘四个边星两侧的区域。 天元：棋盘正中央的一颗星称作“天元”。 中腹：天元周围的区域称为中腹。 小目：棋盘坐标 3·四 的位置称作“小目”。 高目：棋盘坐标 4·五 的位置称作“高目”。 目外：棋盘坐标 3·五 的位置称作“目外”。 三三：棋盘坐标 3·三 的位置称为“三三”。 急所：指对局时，急需抢占的要点之处，无固定位置。 大场：指布局时，棋盘上下子后能够开拆或分投之处。 天王山：“天王山”一词是指在布局阶段，双方大模样（势力）的消涨要点，表示盘面中双方都应抢占的重要的位置。 着法 挂：布局时，在一方有一子占据角部时，另一方在其附近间隔一路或二路的位置行棋，称作“挂”。在三线行棋，称为低挂，在四线行棋，称为高挂。根据双方棋子的相对位置，又可分为一间高挂、二间高挂、一间低挂、二间低挂和小飞挂、大飞挂等。挂的目的在于破坏或侵占对方所占的角部。 缔：也称为“缔角”或“守角”。指在己方原有小目、高目或目外一子的基础上，再下一着棋，使己方两个子相互配合守角的着法。缔角既有利于围占角地，又可进一步控制和开拓边上的大场，是布局阶段常采用的着法。 长：双方棋子紧贴着向同一方向行棋，先行的一方，棋子会始终高出对方一头。长的着法能将己方的棋子连接成一个整体，这样可以延长棋子的气，既可以防止对方的攻击，又便于伺机攻击对方。 立：紧靠着己方原有的棋子，竖着向边线方向下一子的着法。通常多指在二线或三线的行棋。 尖：在原有棋子的斜线上下一子。由于尖的步子较小，也称其为“小尖”。在实战中，尖是一种攻守兼备的下法，既能够保持两子间的连络，又能够出头，控制行棋的方向。 飞：从原有棋子出发，向棋盘“日”字形的对角上下一子，叫小飞。若下在 “目”字形的对角上，就叫做大飞。飞还有一种形式，叫做象步飞。与象棋的象步走法相同。 压：在己方有子力配合的情况下，将棋下在对方棋子的上面，其主要作用是压制对方，扩张自己的外势、使己方的棋更加厚实，强大。压的着法往往还有声东击西的作用。 拆：从原有棋子的同一横线上，向左或向右有间隔地下一子。如果间隔一路，称为“拆一”，若是间隔二路，则称 “拆二”，其余类推。 挡：在双方棋子相互接触时，直接阻拦对方侵入己方地域或阻止对方被围的棋子向外冲出的着法。 扳：双方棋子相互靠紧时，一方从斜线上向对方兜头下一子，以阻止对方的棋子出路的着法。因扳的方向不同，有内扳、外扳、上扳、下扳之分。在一方扳时，对方还有反扳、连扳的着法。 托：在边角地带，紧挨着对方棋子的下边落子。托的着法具有占地、连络、攻击、腾挪、试应手等多种意义。 退：在双方棋子接触时，将被对方挡住前进去路的子向己方退回一步的着法。 虎：在原有呈“小尖”形二子的基础上，再向另一边尖一着，使三子呈现一“品”字形状的走法。 刺：在对方的断点、虎口附近或相当薄弱之处下一子，下一步能立即获得利益或分断对方。刺往往是先手，有迫使对方应一手棋的用意。 鼓：在己方间隔一路的两子中间再下一子，使棋形成为“品”字形。鼓后的形状与“虎”后棋形完全相同，区别在于棋的走法不同。 碰：在无己方棋子接应时，紧靠着对方的棋子旁边下一子，称为碰。通常是用于试探对方怎样应对，追求变化的一种手段。 靠：在有己方棋子作策应的情况下，紧贴对方棋子旁边下一子。 搭：在己方棋子与对方棋子间隔一路的情况下，紧贴对方棋子的两侧下一子的着法。也称作“搭靠”。 接：将可能被对方分断的棋子连接成一体的着法。 粘：zhān ，指将被对方“打吃”的棋子与己方的其它棋子连接成一个整体的着法。 挖：在对方相隔一路的棋子中间下一子的着法。这种着法通常用在能够分断对方棋子，并能有效地攻击对方的场合下。 夹：将对方棋子夹在我方两子中间的着法。 滚：也称滚打。指由己方先弃一、二子，然后把敌子打吃成凝聚形状的着法过程。 打：也称打吃。在对方棋子只有两口气时，再下一子，使其仅剩一口气的状态。 双打：下一子同时打吃对方两边的棋子，形成两者必得其一的着法。 提：下一子，使对方的棋子立即呈现无气被吃状态，随即把被吃的死棋从棋盘上提取掉。 征：也称做“征子”，是围棋中吃棋子的一种方法，俗称“拐羊头”。被“征吃”一方的棋子因只有一口气，如若没有己方棋子接应，即使立即逃出，对方可按预定的行棋次序继续紧气追杀，最终会将其全部吃掉。 顶：在原有一子的情况下，再用一子去顶撞对方棋子的一种着法。 跳：在原有棋子的同一条直线上，间隔一路下子的着法。这一着法是避免被动，使己方快速出头的有效之着。 双：为避免棋子被对方断开，将棋走成四子间隔一路并连起来的形状，俗称“板櫈”。常用于以守为攻的场合。 关：也称作“单关”。在原有棋子的同一条直线上，向中腹方向间隔一路下子的着法。 扑：故意在对方的虎口中送一子，迫使对方吃子而其自紧一气的着法。在双方对杀中常用来紧气和破眼。 挺：也称挺头。为防止己方的棋被对方扳住头而占据出头要点的着法。 贴：指紧随其后贴住对方棋子下子的着法，俗称“后推车”。 枷：将对方的棋子虚罩在己方的势力范围之内，使其无法继续长气和逃出的着法。 渡：在棋盘三路以下的边线上，能使己方两部分棋子取得连络的着法。 拐：双方棋子相互接触时，改变行棋方向，并挡住对方前进方向的走法。 爬：指一方的棋子在对方的压迫下，沿着棋盘二线或一线直线行棋的着法。 冲：指在己方原有棋子的基础上，向对方棋子间隔一路的空隙处冲击的着法。在中盘战斗中，“冲”与“断”经常配合使用。 跨：在己方有子策应的情况下，将子下在对方小飞的棋子旁，其目的是分断对方棋子的连络。 断：也称分断。直接割断对方棋子连络的着法。棋被断开后容易遭到攻击，棋诀之中有“棋从断处生”之说。 挤：向对方棋子集中的空隙处插入一子，使对方的棋形出现断点或缺陷的着法。 卡：qiǎ ，在对方棋形的要害处下一子，使其立即呈现某种缺陷的有效着法。 掖：紧挨着对方成“尖”形的两个子旁边下一子，具有约束对方棋形或使对方棋形出现断点或缺陷的着法。 曲：将棋背向对方的棋子走成弯曲的形状，称为“曲”。 团：将棋走成空三角或凝形的着法。通常在特定的场合下采用。 聚：在对方一块棋所围的空中连续下子，使对方最终无法做成两眼而被聚杀的着法。 补：将薄弱的或有缺陷的棋形加以强化的防御性着法。 逼：在对方棋子尚未安定时，向其逼近攻击，以限制其扩大地域或破坏其形成根据的可能性，逼迫对方选择就地做活或向外逃脱的着法。 镇：俗称“戴帽”。在对方棋子向中央单关的位置上下一子，多用于限制对方的势力，侵消其大模样或对企图出头的棋子进行攻击。 拦：阻止对方继续发展的着法。拦与挡的主要区别是不与对方的棋子直接接触。 打入：直接深入对方控制的势力范围，以达到破空或攻击对方目的的着法。 分投：指在对方势力范围的中央一带下子，并且左右均留有开拆的余地。一般情况下，分投的棋子多数选择下在三线。 吊：在对方势力范围上方行棋的着法。可起到限制、削减对方地域或阵势的作用。 浅消:从外部限制、削减对方的形势或地域。通常具有落子位置较高，不易被对方攻击等特点。 封：封锁对方棋子，防止其向外部发展的着法。 罩：在对方孤棋的外部，距离对方棋子较远处下子，形成一种大范围的势力圈，将对方的孤棋远远地笼罩起来，以威胁其安全的着法。 点：瞄着对方棋形的缺陷或要害位置下一子叫做“点”。 倒扑：也称倒包。在对方虎口内投一子打吃对方，如对方提吃，仍可再吃掉对方若干棋子的着法。 纽十字：对局双方将棋子走成互相绞断的“十字”形状。 肩冲：在对方棋子的斜上方成“尖”形的位置上下一子。除用于削减对方的势力外，还可以用于扩展己方的势力。 双飞燕：布局中常用的着法之一。当一方先占星位后，另一方分别在两边小飞挂，对其进行夹击。因棋形如同飞燕展翅，故而得名。 引征：在被征棋子行棋方向的前方下一子，企图接应被征吃的棋子。 并：在己方原有一子的同一线上并排下一子。一般在棋形有缺陷时，用来加强自己，保持棋的连络。 玉柱：在角部或边上原有一子的基础上再下立一子的着法。用于加强己方的形势或稳固己方地域。 尖顶：紧靠对方的棋子下一子，在使己方棋子成“尖”形的同时，起到顶撞对方棋子的作用。 鼻顶：在对方棋形正前方顶住对方若干棋子的着法。 连：下一子，将两处分开的棋子若即若离地取得联络，以保证大块棋子安全的着法。连的常用着法有跳、关、拆、小飞、大飞、大跳等。 棋形所谓棋形，就是多个棋子在棋盘上共同组合成的具体形状。由于棋子之间的结构、配置不同，棋盘上所呈现的棋形可分为好形、恶形、厚形、薄形、死形、活形及愚形等。 直三：一块被包围的棋，其眼位呈直线形状的三个交叉点，称为“直三”。 曲三：一块被包围的棋，其眼位呈弯曲线形状的三个交叉点，称为“曲三”，也称“拐三”或“弯三”。 直四：一块棋的眼位形状是直线形的四个交叉点，称其为“直四”。 曲四：一块棋的眼位形状是弯曲形的四个交叉点，称其为“曲四”。 方四：一块棋围成的四个交叉点呈方块形状，称其为“方四”。 丁四：该棋形因其围住的四个交叉点呈“丁”字形状而得名。 刀把五：由于棋子围住的五个交叉点形状很像一把菜刀，所以称这种棋形为“刀把五”，简称为“刀五”。 梅花五：指一块棋所围的五个交叉点像花朵样的形状。这种棋形称作“梅花五”简称“花五”。 花六：一块棋围有六个交叉点，其形状也呈花朵样，称其为“梅花六”，简称“花六”，也称“葡萄六”或“聚六”。 板六：一块棋围有六个交叉点，且呈板条形状的棋形称为“板六”。 聚七：指一块棋具有聚在一起的七个交叉点的棋形。 凝形：指众多棋子都凝聚在一起的棋形。 裂形：指己方的棋子被对方分裂开的形状。 愚形：指三个棋子围成的空三角形状。 斗笠形：指四个棋子形成的斗笠形状，也称“草帽形”。 猴子脸：由三个棋子构成的一种棋形，形状犹如猴子脸。 眼位：指能够使棋子做成眼形的具体位置。通常，一整块棋只要有足够的眼位，即至少有能做出两只眼的位置，就可以成为活棋。而眼位的要点就是一块棋中能够做出两只眼的关键位置。 俗称 高手：对棋艺水平很高者的称谓，通常指高段位棋手。 上手：对棋艺水平较高者的称谓，对局时常执白子，向对方授先或让子。 下手：对棋艺水平稍逊者的称谓，对局时常执黑子，由对方授先或让子。 本手：安分守己，掌握分寸的合理之着，也称为正着。 先手：下一着棋后，第二着能起到攻击、杀死对方或削减对方地域的作用，迫使对方不得不应，称为先手。 后手：在对方下子后，不得不应一着棋进行防御，以致被对方获得它投的权利，称为后手。己方下子后，如果对方不应也可称此着为后手。 随手：思考不成熟的草率之着。往往会丧失获取利益的机会，甚至还会造成不同程度的损失。 俗手：表面上看似正常，但实际上已在无形中吃了亏的错着，此种着法很容易被低水平的棋手屡次沿用，甚至成为习惯后仍不知其问题所在。 缓手：也称为“缓着”。是指一种坐失良机，下出当进而不进的松懈之着。此着在局部看似很正常，但就全局而言并不重要。一着棋，在局部看似正常，但就全局而言并不重要。 恶手：对己明显有害无益且有违棋理的错着，通常会带来局部的损失乃至全局的失败。其后果特别严重者，则称之为大恶手。 新手：在局部变化中经得起推敲的创新之着。 妙手：在对局中走出的出人意料的精妙着法，也称为妙着。 强手：指比常规着法更加积极主动或更具有对抗意识的着法。 鬼手：指冷僻而不易被人注意的凶狠、巧妙之着。 嵌手：在定式阶段故走劣着，看似笨拙，实含计谋，布下陷井，诱人上当的着法。 涩手：表面上看似拘谨忍让，实际上是含蓄扼要之着。 试应手：下一着棋，目的在于试探对方如何应对，然后再决定下一步在此局部如何行棋的着法试应手是对局中常用的着法，也称之为“试着”。 疑问手：不够妥善而值得推敲的一着棋。多指不明显的失误，与错着、恶手有着程度上的差别。 命令手：下一着棋，促使对方必须应，并且仅有一种方案可考虑，而无其它选择的余地。 胜负手：它有两种含义：一是指形势不容乐观的一方下出非此不足以扭转局面的关键之着，具有强烈的争胜负意识。二是指关键时刻在某一局部下出使对方非常难以应对的着法。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Game

夹攻：依仗强厚的外势从另一侧来攻击对方棋子，迫使其向己方的厚壁行棋或者出逃，有时候没有外势也可以进行夹攻，在攻击过程中处理好自身，因为攻击是最好的防守。 拆边：拆边，拆撑、拆开之意。特指三线子向同线对边部平行有间距地拆开，为布阵所用。四线子相应拆开，则称高拆。为近代围棋特征之一。 跳间隔：一线向中腹直着下一个子，叫“跳”，又叫“单关”。所谓单关，一般指对应于原有处在三、四线上的子向中腹或边部垂直地有间隔（隔一为单关，隔二为大关或二间关）跳出或跳下。在这种情况下，现今“关”已有被用“跳”取代的趋势。 镇在对方子的上方，间隔一线下一子叫“镇”。 飞攻用飞的办法从高位向低位压迫对方的子叫做“飞压”。 飞出、尖出当对方使用“镇”后，正面的出路被挡，只能用飞或尖的办法斜着出头。 搭用飞或跳的步法靠在对方子上叫“搭”，是一种借力使力的着法，在攻击和防守时常用。 打入：把子下到对方的地盘内，而且没有拆边的余地，这样的下法叫“打入”。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Game

围棋的定式是指在布局时，双方在角部的正确下法，多为棋盘角部向边上发展而衍生的变化，是在对弈者不断实践的基础上形成的局部黑白双方最佳对应手法。 星定式 根据周边棋子配合，黑3可以下在b，白6可以下在a。进行过程中，白4、黑5都可脱先，但白6一般不可脱先，因为脱先被夹后，白4即成浪费己方转换机会的恶手。 如果将挂角视为对对方的发展方向进行限制，黑3的思路是在另一方向寻求展开，之后双方划定势力范围。但黑5中途也可以在白2下方夹或碰。夹的用意是在征子情况有利的前提下转而取势，此时白棋通常进角求活。碰则是寻求复杂变化。今后黑棋可于a位点后于2位左侧盖，来扩张上边的势力范围。今后5位右侧是对双方而言出入巨大的官子。 对于星位挂角，黑3夹，也可以在a、b、c、d、e等位置夹，寻求攻击时白棋总可以点角转身做活。如果黑棋重视右边发展而挡在黑5，以下的次序不可颠倒。黑7不可扳，否则白8扳粘后于白12位夹，黑棋难办。白8当然也不能于白12位跳，黑棋可以直接冲断。 之后，黑棋可于1位继续扩张，此时白于2位并是本手。或者也可于4位夹，逼迫白棋挺出。或者更直接于白12位下压。如果黑3的位置偏上，黑棋往往不需要在3位虎补。但如果黑3的位置过远，白棋有伺机出动白2一子的可能性。 如果黑棋计划在另一侧构筑外势，可选择这个定式。黑9是联络的手筋，否则有被扳断的弱点。右边白棋二路托时，黑棋退即可。今后白棋对于黑棋上边的二路扳需要留心，如果下方被封死这个扳粘是先手。 小目定式 特殊情况下白6可脱先，但白8一般不可。根据配合黑7也可于下图b位尖。如果黑棋a位有子，则有黑b打入的手段，白棋需要留意。 根据配合白6也可以粘，这样白8可以高拆。 如果黑棋特别重视上边，可以选择于黑3飞，虽然角部实空会稍有损失。黑7可以更强硬地在a位长。黑3也可于b位跳，此时黑棋不需在黑7虎而应当在a位长。但是，一般来说，如果黑3走在b位，往往意味着黑5要在6位扳。如果接下来黑棋打吃后虎起，这是骗着，小心应对。 黑棋在a位或3位夹可以引发战斗，最简明的变化是白棋逃出，然后伺机夹击黑3一子。今后白棋可以以白b、黑c、白d、黑e的顺序搜刮角部。黑5也可能拆二。 以现代棋的节奏而言，白棋小飞挂角时黑棋一定会夹。如果黑棋夹得比较远，如图中黑3、a、b、c，白棋可以选择4位，黑棋大概5位爬。如果黑棋想战斗也可以冲断，此后变化会非常复杂。如果黑棋不想给白棋如下图的利用，黑7也可以多爬一路（虽然更缓）。 白14于黑13左边断。 但是，对于一间低夹，如果白4飞压，黑棋再爬就太委屈了，几乎一定会于本图冲断。结果白棋安定，大致两分。但考虑到黑3夹击的用意，此图黑棋大概不满。所以一间低夹往往起不到攻击的效果。黑11也可于a位跳出战斗，接下来白棋于b位跳是进攻的手筋。 一间高夹是小飞挂中最严厉的，此时白棋不可飞压，否则被冲断后无法收拾。大致如下图白4跳，黑5飞。此后容易形成战斗。一个妥协的方案如下图所示。 此后白b官子极大。白12也可以于13位挖，此后黑a，白12，黑b，黑棋不如本图厚，但实地比本图多。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Game 棋牌","slug":"Game-棋牌","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Game-%E6%A3%8B%E7%89%8C/"}]},{"title":"Baduk 🧇 围棋

A complete operation in a four-stroke engine requires two revolutions (720°) of the crankshaft. Parts of a Four Stroke EnginePistonIn an engine, a piston transfers the expanding forces of gas to mechanical rotation of the crankshaft through a connecting rod. CrankshaftA crankshaft is a part that converts the reciprocating motion to rotational motion. Connecting RodIt transfers motion from a piston to crankshaft acting as a lever arm FlywheelThe flywheel is a rotating mechanical device that is used to store energy. Inlet and Outlet ValvesIt allows us to enter fresh air with fuel &amp; to exit the spent air-fuel mixture from the cylinder. Spark PlugIt is a device that delivers electric current to the combustion chamber which ignites the air-fuel mixture leading to the abrupt expansion of gas. Four Stroke Engine CycleThe four strokes of the engine go by the following names: Suction&#x2F;Intake StrokeIntake stroke occurs when the air-fuel mixture is introduced to the combustion chamber. In this stroke, the piston moves from TDC (Top Dead Center – the farthest position of piston to the crankshaft) to BDC (Bottom Dead Center – the nearest position of piston to the crankshaft.) The movement of the piston towards the BDC creates a low-pressure area in the cylinder. The inlet valve remains to open a few degrees of crankshaft rotation after BDC. The intake valve then closes and the air-fuel mixture is sealed in the cylinder Inlet Valve – Open Outlet Valve ­­ – Closed Crankshaft Rotation – 180° Compression StrokeIn compression stroke, the trapped air-fuel mixture is compressed inside the cylinder. During the stroke, the piston moves from BDC to TDC compressing the air-fuel mixture. The momentum of the flywheel helps the piston move forward. Compressing the air-fuel mixture allows more energy to be released when the charge is ignited. The charge is the volume of compressed air-fuel mixture trapped inside the combustion chamber ready for ignition. The inlet and outlet valves must be closed to ensure that the cylinder is sealed resulting in compression. Inlet Valve – Closed Outlet Valve ­­ – Closed Crankshaft Rotation – 180° (Total 360°) Power&#x2F;Combustion StrokeThe second rotation of the crankshaft has begun when it completes a full rotation during the compression stroke. The power stroke occurs when the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited with the help of a spark plug. Ignition or Combustion is the rapid, oxidizing chemical reaction in which a fuel chemically combines with oxygen in the atmosphere and releases energy in the form of heat. The hot expanding gases force the piston head away from the cylinder head. Inlet Valve – Closed Outlet Valve ­­ – Closed Crankshaft Rotation – 180° (Total 540°) Exhaust StrokeAs the piston reaches BDC during the power stroke, combustion is complete and the cylinder is filled with exhaust gases. The exhaust valves open during this stroke and the inertia of the flywheel and other moving parts push the piston back to TDC, forcing the exhaust gases through the open exhaust valve. At the end of the exhaust stroke, the piston is at TDC and one operating cycle has been completed. Inlet Valve – Closed Outlet Valve ­­ – Open Crankshaft Rotation – 180° (Total 720°) Comparison Between 2-stroke engine and a 4-stroke engine A 4-stroke engine weighs 50% heavier than a 2-stroke engine. A 4-stroke engine is more efficient than a 2-stroke engine because fuel is consumed once every 4 strokes. A 2-stroke engine creates more torque at a higher RPM, while a 4-stroke engine creates a higher torque at a lower RPM. A 4-stroke engine is quieter than a 2-stroke engine. 2-stroke engines tend to wear out fast because they are designed to run at a higher RPM. 2-stroke engines are easier to fix because of simple construction. 4-stroke engines have complex designs with more parts making them more expensive and repairs cost more. Two-stroke engines are typically found in smaller applications such as chainsaws, boat motors, and dirt bikes. Four-stroke engines are found in go-karts, lawnmowers, and combustion engines in your car.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Swiss Tools 🛠 瑞士工具","slug":"2020-12-15-00-28-swiss-tools","date":"2020-12-14T16:28:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:40:18.384Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/15/2020-12-15-00-28-swiss-tools/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/15/2020-12-15-00-28-swiss-tools/","excerpt":"PB Swiss Tools has been developing and producing uncompromising Swiss quality since 1878: precise, innovative and reliable.

A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: condensing coil expansion valve evaporator coil compressor There are eight main components that play a pivotal role in cooling your home: A Thermostat, Condenser, Compressor, Fan, Metering Device, Evaporator, Blower and a Filter. The first step begins with setting your thermostat to the desired temperature. This triggers the condenser fan and compressor to turn on. The compressor begins pumping a fluid called a ‘refrigerant’ throughout the system. This is used because of its low boiling point.Refrigerant constantly changes from a vapor to a liquid in order to move heat from inside your home to the outdoors. It enters the compressor as a low-temperature, low-pressure vapor. After it’s compressed, it leaves as a high-temperature, high-pressure vapor.It then travels through the condenser coil, where the vapor condenses into a liquid. The heat it has collected indoors and after compression, is released outside. The fan inside the unit helps with this process. The refrigerant leaves the condenser as a medium-temperature, high-pressure liquid.Then, flows to the metering device. In this case, a thermal expansion valve is used. A pin inside the valve adjusts the flow rate of refrigerant depending on the temperature at the evaporator end, using a ‘sensing bulb’.As it flows through the valve, its pressure drops significantly, releasing a low-temperature, low-pressure liquid&#x2F;vapor mix. The lower pressure allows room temperature air to boil the refrigerant. The chilled refrigerant then flows through the evaporator coil. The blower begins circulating air throughout the house. Room-temperature air is pulled in through the return duct and passes through the filter to remove particulates. The heat from the air is absorbed into the refrigerant inside the evaporator coil, dispersing chilled air through the supply duct.As the air passes over the coil, the refrigerant is boiled and evaporates back into vapor form. During this process, condensation forms on the outside of the coil and exits through a condensate drain line.The refrigerant returns to the condenser to disperse the collected heat outdoors, and the cycle starts again. Your home is slowly cooled, and the thermostat shuts off the equipment once it senses the desired temperature.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Engine Start Motor 🚖 发动机启动马达","slug":"2020-12-13-15-13-engine-start-motor","date":"2020-12-13T07:13:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:44:23.282Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/13/2020-12-13-15-13-engine-start-motor/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/13/2020-12-13-15-13-engine-start-motor/","excerpt":"The starter motor is an electric motor that turns over or “cranks” the engine to start.

The starter motor has a pinion, which meshes with the teeth on the flywheel of the engine and turns the crankshaft. The model shown here is a pre-engaged type starter motor used in modern vehicles. It uses an electric motor to provide torque to the crankshaft. The power for this motor can be drawn from the battery. A simplified circuit of power supply is shown here. The power from the battery is supplied to a solenoid. An ignition switch is installed between the battery and the solenoid to turn the power on and off. The solenoid is an electromagnet which requires small current to get energized. As the ignition switch is turned on, the solenoid gets energized. A moving core known as a plunger slides along the coil, which connects two copper terminals of a contactor switch. This completes the circuit from the battery to the motor and causes the rotor to spin. When the solenoid is de-energized the core returns back and disconnects the motor from the battery. We may wonder why the solenoid and the contactor are used instead of directly connecting the battery to the motor and reducing the complexity. The reason behind not using this circuit is the high current demand of the motor. The motor is considerably powerful and demands heavy current for operation. To handle this current, the ignition switch needs to be unusually large. It also requires very thick wires running from the battery to the switch, and then to the motor which is technically inconvenient. This is why solenoid is used which demands lower current for being energized. The solenoid has another crucial function, it helps to slide the pinion and engage it with a flywheel before the motor starts to spin. As the pinion slides towards the flywheel, it slightly rotates on its axis as shown here. This rotation is achieved by using a helical spline. This rotation helps meshing the pinion with the flywheel more conveniently as the pinion and flywheel is properly meshed the contactor switch gets closed and the motor spins. As we can observe that the pinion is considerably small compared to the flywheel. The gear ratio of the flywheel and pinion is generally from fifteen to one to twenty to one the high torque obtained from this gear reduction is still insufficient to crank the engine. So a planetary gear set is introduced to increase the torque further. Planetary gears are incredibly useful for large gear reductions with less weight and limited space. It consists of a sun gear, a ring gear, a carrier, and a set of planet gears. In starters the ring gear is fixed the sun gear is the input and the planet carrier is the output. For the setup shown here the gear ratio is seven to one. The combined gear reduction results in enough torque to spin the engine. As the engine is started, the pinion needs to be disengaged from the flywheel to prevent back drive of the motor, which might damage it due to the excessive speed. This is done by releasing the ignition switch, which de-energizes the solenoid and the pinion returns back. But if the operator fails to release the ignition switch, as soon as the engine is started. The flywheel will drive the pinion too fast and damage the motor to prevent this, a one-way clutch is used. The one-way clutch has a set of rollers installed between the outer and inner races. When the outer race is rotated by the motor the rollers get trapped and transfer power to the pinion. As soon as the engine is started and drives the pinion at a high speed, the rollers get released and power transfer is stopped.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"}]},{"title":"Stereographic Projection 🗺 球面投影","slug":"2020-12-12-20-08-stereographic-projection","date":"2020-12-12T12:08:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-08T15:00:21.045Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-20-08-stereographic-projection/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-20-08-stereographic-projection/","excerpt":"In geometry, the stereographic projection is a particular mapping (function) that projects a sphere onto a plane.

It is conformal, meaning that it preserves angles at which curves meet. It is neither isometric nor area-preserving: that is, it preserves neither distances nor the areas of figures. Intuitively, then, the stereographic projection is a way of picturing the sphere as the plane, with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications, so does the stereographic projection; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. In practice, the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a stereographic net, shortened to stereonet, or Wulff net. A map projection obtained by projecting points P on the surface of sphere from the sphere’s north pole N to point $P^{‘}$ in a plane tangent to the south pole S. In such a projection, great circles are mapped to circles, and loxodromes become logarithmic spirals. Stereographic projections have a very simple algebraic form that results immediately from similarity of triangles. In the above figures, let the stereographic sphere have radius r, and the z-axis positioned as shown. Then a variety of different transformation formulas are possible depending on the relative positions of the projection plane and z-axis. The transformation equations for a sphere of radius R are given by $$\\begin{aligned}&amp;x&#x3D;k \\cos \\phi \\sin \\left(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0}\\right) \\&amp;y&#x3D;k\\left[\\cos \\phi_{1} \\sin \\phi-\\sin \\phi_{1} \\cos \\phi \\cos \\left(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\lambda_{0}$ is the central longitude, $\\phi_{1}$ is the central latitude, and $$k&#x3D;\\frac{2 R}{1+\\sin \\phi_{1} \\sin \\phi+\\cos \\phi_{1} \\cos \\phi \\cos \\left(\\lambda-\\lambda_{0}\\right)}$$ The inverse formulas for latitude $\\phi$ and longitude $\\lambda$ are then given by $$\\begin{aligned}&amp;\\phi&#x3D;\\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\cos c \\sin \\phi_{1}+\\frac{y \\sin c \\cos \\phi_{1}}{\\rho}\\right) \\&amp;\\lambda&#x3D;\\lambda_{0}+\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x \\sin c}{\\rho \\cos \\phi_{1} \\cos c-y \\sin \\phi_{1} \\sin c}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ where $$\\begin{aligned}&amp;\\rho&#x3D;\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} \\&amp;c&#x3D;2 \\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{2 R}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ and the two-argument form of the inverse tangent function is best used for this computation. For an oblate spheroid, $R$ can be interpreted as the “local radius,” defined by $$R&#x3D;\\frac{R_{e} \\cos \\phi}{\\left(1-e^{2} \\sin ^{2} \\phi\\right) \\cos \\chi}$$ where $R_{e}$ is the equatorial radius and $\\chi$ is the conformal latitude. Use of the β and π Methods to Determine Fold OrientationThe orientation of bedding measured at different locations across a fold can be used to determine the attitude of the fold axis and of the axial plane. The readings have introduced these methods. In this article, we will use the following strike and dip measurements of folded beds to illustrate the methods: 110°&#x2F;40°SW 150°&#x2F;45°SW 080°&#x2F;40°SE 040°&#x2F;50°SE 005°&#x2F;70°SE 050°&#x2F;45°SE 132°&#x2F;60°SW The β-diagramOn a new overlay, plot the fold limb orientations as planes. Mark each intersection between planes with a point. If more than two planes intersect at a single location, draw a circle around the point for each additional plane. Mark the centre of density of the point distribution. In Figure above (labs), the centre of density is marked with a star. Use the circles to help you to account for the extra “weight” of intersections of more than two planes. One way to think about the weight of points is to imagine each intersection as a small magnet. Where more than two planes intersect, there is an additional magnet for each additional plane. Now imagine that you have a small iron sphere suspended on a string. If you were to hold the sphere just above the centre of the cluster of magnets, each magnet would exert a force on the sphere; magnets located closer together would have a stronger pull on the sphere than a single magnet by itself. Therefore, the suspend sphere might be pulled more to one side than another. The centre of density of the point distribution is the point above which the sphere would come to rest. The centre of density on a β-diagram is referred to as a β-axis. It is an estimate of the orientation of the fold axis. In our example, the β-axis has an orientation of 40°&#x2F;172°. The π-diagramOn a new overlay, plot the poles to the fold limb orientations. Rotate the overlay until you find the great circle that best fits the set of poles. If the fold measurements are correct, your plotting is correct, and the fold is perfectly cylindrical, then all of the poles should fall on a single great circle. In this example, however, this is not the case, so a great circle has been chosen using the following criteria: Many of the poles fall on the great circle, or very close to the great circle. For poles that do not fall on the great circle, an attempt is made to distribute them as evenly as possible on either side of the great circle. The great circle you choose to fit the poles is called the π-circle. Find the pole to the π-circle. This is called the π-axis. The π-axis for this example is oriented 40°&#x2F;175°. The π-axis, like the β-axis, is an estimate of the fold axis. Under ideal circumstances, the β-axis you calculate should be the same as the π-axis. This unusual, however, because it is much more difficult to judge the centre of density of a point cluster than it is to fit a curve to a set of points. The π-diagram can also be used to estimate the orientation of the axial plane. To do this, we use the angle between the fold limbs, called the interlimb angle. The interlimb angle can be estimated from the spread of the poles along the π-circle. In Figure below, the interlimb angle measured through the poles is 105°. (You can measure this by rotating your stereonet until the π-circle lies on a great circle, and then counting off the distance.) Note, however, that there are actually two possible interlimb angles: The other is 75°. To decide which interlimb angle to use requires that you have some additional knowledge about the shape of the fold. If the fold is tightly closed and has an interlimb angle of less than 90°, then you would use 75°. If the fold is less tightly closed, and has an interlimb angle greater than 90°, then you would use 105°. Regardless of which interlimb angle you use, the procedure is the same. First, mark the midpoint (x) of the interlimb angle. Next, rotate your overlay until the midpoint and the π-axis lie on the same great circle, and trace the great circle to find the limb bisectrix, the plane that lies exactly between the limbs of the fold (as represented by your data). The limb bisectrix is an approximation of the axial plane. If we had independent information that the fold was not tightly closed, then we would choose the great circle connecting the midpoint of the 105° angle ($M_{1}$) and the π-axis.

The names that can be named are not unvarying names. It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang; The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures, each after its kind. Truly, ‘Only he that rids himself forever of desire can see the Secret Essences’; He that has never rid himself of desire can see only the Outcomes. These two things issued from the same mould, but nevertheless are different in name. This same mould we can but call the Mystery, Or rather the Darker than any Mystery, The Doorway whence issued all Secret Essences. It is because every one under Heaven recognizes beauty as beauty, that the idea of ugliness exists. And equally if every one recognized virtue as virtue, this would merely create fresh conceptions of wickedness. For truly ‘Being and Not-being grow out of one another; Difficult and easy complete one another. Long and short test one another. High and low determine one another. Pitch and mode give harmony to one another. Front and back give sequence to one another’. Therefore the Sage relies on actionless activity, Carries on wordless teaching, But the myriad creatures are worked upon by him; he does not disown them. He rears them, but does not lay claim to them, Controls them, but does not lean upon them, Achieves his aim, but does not call attention to what he does; And for the very reason that he does not call attention to what he does He is not ejected from fruition of what he has done. If we stop looking for persons of superior morality (Xián / 贤) to put in power, there will be no more jealousies among the people. If we cease to set store by products that are hard to get, there will be no more thieves. If the people never see such things as excite desire, their hearts will remain placid and undisturbed. Therefore the Sage rules By emptying their hearts And filling their bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening their sinews Ever striving to make the people knowledgeless and desireless. Indeed he sees to it that if there be any who have knowledge, they dare not interfere. Yet through his actionless activity all things are duly regulated. The Dào is like an empty vessel That yet may be drawn from Without ever needing to be filled. It is bottomless; the very progenitor of all things in the world. In it all sharpness is blunted, All tangles untied, All glare tempered, All dust smoothed. It is like a deep pool that never dries. Was it too the child of something else? We cannot tell. But as a substanceless image it existed before the Ancestor. Heaven and Earth are ruthless; To them the Ten Thousand Things are but as straw dogs. The Sage too is ruthless; To him the people are but as straw dogs. Yet Heaven and Earth and all that lies between Is like a bellows In that it is empty, but gives a supply that never fails. Work it, and more comes out. Whereas the force of words is soon spent. Far better is it to keep what is in the heart. The Valley Spirit never dies. It is named the Mysterious Female. And the Doorway of the Mysterious Female Is the base from which Heaven and Earth sprang. It is there within us all the while; Draw upon it as you will, it never runs dry. Heaven is eternal, the Earth Everlasting. How come they to be so? Is it because they do not foster their own lives; That is why they live so long. Therefore the Sage Puts himself in the background; but is always to the fore. Remains outside; but is always there. Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end That all his personal ends are fulfilled? The highest good is like that of water. The goodness of water is that it benefits the ten thousand creatures; yet itself does not scramble, but is content with the places that all men disdain. It is this that makes water so near to the Dào. And if men think the ground the best place for building a house upon, If among thoughts they value those that are profound, If in friendship they value gentleness, In words, truth; in government, good order; In deeds, effectiveness; in actions, timeliness – In each case it is because they prefer what does not lead to strife, And therefore does not go amiss. Stretch a bow to the very full, And you will wish you had stopped in time; Temper a sword-edge to its very sharpest, And you will find it soon grows dull When bronze and jade fill your hall It can no longer be guarded. Wealth and place breed insolence That brings ruin in its train. When your work is done, then withdraw! Such is Heaven’s Way. When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? Dào produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it；it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called The mysterious Quality (of the Dào). There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it, for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard，and the weak the strong，but no one is able to carry it out in practice.Therefore a sage has said, He who accepts his state’s reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars‘lord; To him who bears men‘s direful woes They all the name of King accord. Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Dé) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. 《道德经 &#x2F; Dào Dé Jīng》, 春秋时期老子 (李耳) 的哲学作品，又称《道德真经》、《老子》、《五千言》、《老子五千文》,是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作。 道德经分上下两篇, 原文上篇《德经》、下篇《道经》, 不分章。 《道德经》文本以哲学意义之“道德”为纲宗,论述修身、治国、用兵、养生之道, 而多以政治为旨归, 乃所谓“内圣外王”之学。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Chinese 国学","slug":"Chinese-国学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Chinese-%E5%9B%BD%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Logic Gate 🪫 门电路","slug":"2020-12-12-15-25-logic-gate","date":"2020-12-12T07:25:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:47:43.527Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-15-25-logic-gate/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-15-25-logic-gate/","excerpt":"A logic gate is an idealized model of computation or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.

With amplification, logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic. Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates. In modern practice, most gates are made from MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors). Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert (AOI) and OR-AND-Invert (OAI) are often employed in circuit design because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Computer/"}]},{"title":"Microservices 🔗 微服务","slug":"2020-12-12-15-16-microservices","date":"2020-12-12T07:16:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:48:17.016Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-15-16-microservices/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-15-16-microservices/","excerpt":"Microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. A consensus view has evolved over time in the industry. Some of the defining characteristics that are frequently cited include: Services in a microservice architecture (MSA) are often processes that communicate over a network to fulfil a goal using technology-agnostic protocols such as HTTP. Services are organized around business capabilities. Services can be implemented using different programming languages, databases, hardware and software environment, depending on what fits best. Services are small in size, messaging-enabled, bounded by contexts, autonomously developed, independently deployable, decentralized and built and released with automated processes. A microservice is not a layer within a monolithic application (example, the web controller, or the backend-for-frontend).Rather it is a self-contained piece of business functionality with clear interfaces, and may, through its own internal components, implement a layered architecture. From a strategy perspective, microservices architecture essentially follows the Unix philosophy of “Do one thing and do it well”. Martin Fowler describes a microservices-based architecture as having the following properties: Lends itself to a continuous delivery software development process. A change to a small part of the application only requires rebuilding and redeploying only one or a small number of services. Adheres to principles such as fine-grained interfaces (to independently deployable services), business-driven development (e.g. domain-driven design). It is common for microservices architectures to be adopted for cloud-native applications,serverless computing, and applications using lightweight container deployment.According to Fowler, because of the large number (when compared to monolithic application implementations) of services,decentralized continuous delivery and DevOps with holistic service monitoring are necessary to effectively develop, maintain, and operate such applications. A consequence of (and rationale for) following this approach is that the individual microservices can be individually scaled.In the monolithic approach, an application supporting three functions would have to be scaled in its entirety even if only one of these functions had a resource constraint.With microservices, only the microservice supporting the function with resource constraints needs to be scaled out, thus providing resource and cost optimization benefits.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Computer/"}]},{"title":"CPU 💻 中央处理器","slug":"2020-12-12-13-29-cpu","date":"2020-12-12T05:29:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:48:36.945Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/12/2020-12-12-13-29-cpu/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-13-29-cpu/","excerpt":"A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor,main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program.

The most common fuels sold are gasoline (petrol) or diesel fuel. Many gas stations have a convenience store close to the pumps, to make extra earnings. Some have tunnel car washs. Fuel dispensers are used to pump gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, alcohol fuel (like methanol, ethanol, butanol, propanol), biofuels (like straight vegetable oil, biodiesel), or other types of fuel into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle. Besides fuel dispensers, one other significant device which is also found in filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tires. Most filling stations are built in a similar manner, with most of the fueling installation underground, pump machines in the forecourt and a point of service inside a building. Single or multiple fuel tanks are usually deployed underground. Local regulations and environmental concerns may require a different method, with some stations storing their fuel in container tanks, entrenched surface tanks or unprotected fuel tanks deployed on the surface. Fuel is usually offloaded from a tanker truck into each tank by gravity through a separate capped opening located on the station’s perimeter. Fuel from the tanks travels to the dispenser pumps through underground pipes. For every fuel tank, direct access must be available at all times. Most tanks can be accessed through a service canal directly from the forecourt. 加油站是出售机动车辆燃料和润滑剂的设施。出售的最常见的燃料是汽油或柴油。许多加油站都在靠近泵的地方设有便利店，以增加收入。有些设有自动通道洗车场。 加油机是直接为机动车加油的输油计量设备。它与油罐、管线、管件阀门等构成了一个完整的供油系统。加油机是由油泵、油气分离器、计量器、计数器四大总成以及电动机、油枪等其他一些部件构成，任何各类加油机都可看作是由这大总成和其他一些简单的部件构成。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Business 商业","slug":"Business-商业","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Business-%E5%95%86%E4%B8%9A/"}]},{"title":"Formulas 🧮 数学公式 1948-1994","slug":"2020-12-10-10-43-formulas-1948-1994","date":"2020-12-10T02:43:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:49:25.538Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-43-formulas-1948-1994/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-43-formulas-1948-1994/","excerpt":"1948$$H(S) \\leqslant m(S) \\leqslant H(S) + 1$$ The mathematician Claude Shannon introduced the entropy in information theory in 1948.

Calculating how much information is in a random variable, $X&#x3D;{x_{0}, x_{1}, …. , x_{n}}$ is same as calculating the information for the probability distribution of the events in the random variable. In that sense, entropy is considered as average bits of information required to represent an event drawn from the probability distribution. Entropy for a random variable X can be computed using the below equation: $${ Entropy, } \\ H(X)&#x3D;-\\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n} P\\left(x_{i}\\right) \\log_{2}\\left(P\\left(x_{i} \\right) \\right)$$ 1971$$P \\stackrel{?}{&#x3D;} N P$$ In 1971, Stephen Cook introduced the precise statement of the P versus NP problem in his article “The complexity of theorem proving procedures”.

The logistic map is a discrete recursive mathematical function that maps the output of one iteration of the function onto the input of the next. Thus the logistic map is a simple mathematical way of examining the effects of feedback on population growth. 1994$$\\begin{array}{c}x^{n}+y^{n}&#x3D;z^{n} \\quad n&gt;2 \\&#x3D;&gt; \\x y z&#x3D;0\\end{array}$$ In 1994, Andrew Wiles, 62, cracked Fermat’s Last Theorem, which was put forth by 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat. In number theory, Fermat’s Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat’s conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers x, y, and z satisfy the equation $x^{n} + y^{n} &#x3D; z^{n}$ for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n &#x3D; 1 and n &#x3D; 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions. The proposition was first stated as a theorem by Pierre de Fermat around 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica; Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. Although other statements claimed by Fermat without proof were subsequently proven by others and credited as theorems of Fermat (for instance, Fermat’s theorem on sums of two squares), Fermat’s Last Theorem resisted proof, leading to doubt that Fermat ever had a correct proof and it becoming known as a conjecture rather than a theorem. After 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995; it was described as a “stunning advance” in the citation for Wiles’s Abel Prize award in 2016. It also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Formulas 🧮 数学公式 1901-1927","slug":"2020-12-10-10-41-formulas-1901-1927","date":"2020-12-10T02:41:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:49:31.146Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-41-formulas-1901-1927/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-41-formulas-1901-1927/","excerpt":"1901$$\\begin{array}{c}P\\left(\\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\\cdots+X_{n}-n_{\\mu}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{n}} \\leq x\\right) \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} e^{-t^{2} &#x2F; 2} d t\\end{array}$$ Lyapunov’s theorem in probability theory is a theorem that establishes very general sufficient conditions for the convergence of the distributions of sums of independent random variables to the normal distribution.

It not only adequately explains the apparent absence of the relative motion of the Earth with respect to the ether, as indicated by the experiments of Michelson and Morley, but also paved the way for Einstein’s special theory of relativity. It may well be said that Lorentz was regarded by all theoretical physicists as the world’s leading spirit, who completed what was left unfinished by his predecessors and prepared the ground for the fruitful reception of the new ideas based on the quantum theory. 1914$$\\frac{1}{\\pi}&#x3D;\\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{99^{2}} \\sum_{n&#x3D;0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(4 n) !}{(n !)^{4}} \\frac{(1103+26390 n)}{396^{4 n}}$$ In 1914, Ramanujan found a formula for computing π (pi) that is currently the basis for the fastest algorithms used to calculate π. The circle method, which he developed with G. H. Hardy, constitute a large area of current mathematical research. Moreover, Ramanujan discovered K3 surfaces which play key roles today in string theory and quantum physics; while his mock modular forms are being used in an effort to unlock the secret of black holes.

As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-Euclidean geometry arises by either relaxing the metric requirement, or replacing the parallel postulate with an alternative. Between 1820 and 1823, János Bolyai, a Hungarian mathematician, prepared, but did not immediately publish, a treatise on a complete system of non-Euclidean geometry. Completely independent from Bolyai, in the distant provincial Russian city of Kazan, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky had also been working, along very similar lines as Bolyai, to develop a geometry in which Euclid’s fifth postulate did not apply. His work on hyperbolic geometry was first reported in 1826 and published in 1830, although it did not have general circulation until some time later. This early non-Euclidean geometry is now often referred to as Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, thus sharing the credit. 1838$$\\frac{d N}{d t}&#x3D;r N\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)$$ Pierre François Verhulst developed the logistic function in a series of three papers between 1838 and 1847, based on research on modeling population growth that he conducted in the mid 1830s, under the guidance of Adolphe Quetelet. The concept of R&#x2F;K selection theory derives its name from the competing dynamics of exponential growth and carrying capacity. 1822 1842$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+u \\cdot \\nabla u&#x3D;-\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p+v \\nabla^{2} u+g$$ In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations (&#x2F;nævˈjeɪ stoʊks&#x2F;) are a set of partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes. The equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. 1848$$\\iint_{S} K d A&#x3D;2 \\pi \\chi(S)$$ The Gauss–Bonnet formula, is a relationship between surfaces in differential geometry. It connects the curvature of a surface (from geometry) to its Euler characteristic (from topology). In the simplest application, the case of a triangle on a plane, the sum of its angles is 180 degrees. The Gauss–Bonnet formula extends this to more complicated shapes and curved surfaces, connecting the local and global geometries. The theorem is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who developed a version but never published it, and Pierre Ossian Bonnet, who published a special case in 1848. 1864$$\\begin{array}{cc}\\nabla \\cdot E&#x3D;0 &amp; \\nabla \\cdot B&#x3D;0 \\\\nabla \\times E&#x3D;-\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t} &amp; \\nabla \\times B&#x3D;\\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\end{array}$$ Maxwell’s equations are a set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits. The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, wireless communication, lenses, radar etc. 1870$$l^{2} \\geq 4 \\pi A$$ The isoperimetric inequality is a geometric inequality involving the perimeter of a set and its volume. It relates the square of the circumference of a closed curve and the area of a plane region it encloses. 1884$$P&#x3D;\\sum_{k} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{E_{k}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$ In statistical mechanics, a canonical ensemble is the statistical ensemble that represents the possible states of a mechanical system in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at a fixed temperature. The system can exchange energy with the heat bath, so that the states of the system will differ in total energy. The principal thermodynamic variable of the canonical ensemble, determining the probability distribution of states, is the absolute temperature (symbol: T). The ensemble typically also depends on mechanical variables such as the number of particles in the system (symbol: N) and the system’s volume (symbol: V), each of which influence the nature of the system’s internal states. An ensemble with these three parameters is sometimes called the NVT ensemble. 1896$$\\pi(n) \\sim \\frac{n}{\\log n}$$ In number theory, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs. The theorem was proved independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin in 1896 using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann (in particular, the Riemann zeta function). The first such distribution found is $π(N)$ ~ $N &#x2F; log(N)$, where $π(N)$ is the prime-counting function (the number of primes less than or equal to N) and $log(N)$ is the natural logarithm of N. This means that for large enough N, the probability that a random integer not greater than N is prime is very close to $1 &#x2F; log(N)$. Consequently, a random integer with at most 2n digits (for large enough n) is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime ($log(101000) ≈ 2302.6$), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime ($log(102000) ≈ 4605.2$). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first N integers is roughly $log(N)$.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Formulas 🧮 数学公式 1500-1799","slug":"2020-12-10-10-28-formulas-1500-1799","date":"2020-12-10T02:28:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:49:44.514Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-28-formulas-1500-1799/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/10/2020-12-10-10-28-formulas-1500-1799/","excerpt":"1500$$\\begin{aligned}&amp;x^{3} + mx &#x3D; n\\&amp;\\Rightarrow\\&amp;x&#x3D;\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{n^{2}}{4}+\\frac{m^{3}}{27}}+\\frac{n}{2}}-\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{n^{2}}{4}+\\frac{m^{3}}{27}}-\\frac{n}{2}}\\end{aligned}$$ At some point in the early 1500’s, an Italian mathematician named Scipione del Ferro determined a general solution for what is known as the depressed cubic equation.

As it turns out, any cubic equation of the form $x^{3} + bx^{2} + cx + d &#x3D; 0$ can be written as a depressed cubic, but that came later. At the time, mathematicians didn’t publish their results, but, instead, kept them secret so that they could win the problem contests that were common at the time in Italy. As a result, del Ferro didn’t tell anyone about his discovery until shortly before his death in 1526. He then revealed the secret to a student of his named Antonio Maria Fior. In 1535, Fior used this knowledge to challenge a better mathematicain named Niccolo Fontana to a problem contest. 1636$$a^{p} \\equiv a \\quad \\bmod p$$ Fermat’s little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a − a is an integer multiple of p. In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as aᵖ≡a mod p. For example, if a &#x3D; 2 and p &#x3D; 7, then 2⁷ &#x3D; 128, and 128 − 2 &#x3D; 126 &#x3D; 7 × 18 is an integer multiple of 7. If a is not divisible by p, Fermat’s little theorem is equivalent to the statement that a − 1 is an integer multiple of p, or in symbols: aᵖ⁻¹≡1 mod p. For example, if a &#x3D; 2 and p &#x3D; 7, then 26 &#x3D; 64, and 64 − 1 &#x3D; 63 &#x3D; 7 × 9 is thus a multiple of 7. Fermat’s little theorem is the basis for the Fermat primality test and is one of the fundamental results of elementary number theory. The theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat, who stated it in 1640. It is called the “little theorem” to distinguish it from Fermat’s last theorem. 1637$$\\begin{array}{c}x^{n}+y^{n}&#x3D;z^{n} \\quad n&gt;2 \\&#x3D;&gt; \\x y z&#x3D;0\\end{array}$$ In number theory, Fermat’s Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat’s conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers x, y, and z satisfy the equation $x^{n} + y^{n} &#x3D; z^{n}$ for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n &#x3D; 1 and n &#x3D; 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions. 1674$$\\frac{\\pi}{4}&#x3D;1-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{7}+\\cdots$$ In mathematics, the Leibniz formula for ${\\pi}$, named after Gottfried Leibniz. It is also called the Madhava–Leibniz series as it is a special case of a more general series expansion for the inverse tangent function, first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in the 14th century, the specific case first published by Leibniz around 1674. The series for the inverse tangent function, which is also known as Gregory’s series, can be given by: $$\\arctan x&#x3D;x-\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+\\frac{x^{5}}{5}-\\frac{x^{7}}{7}+\\cdots$$ The Leibniz formula for $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ can be obtained by putting x &#x3D; 1 into this series. It also is the Dirichlet L-series of the non-principal Dirichlet character of modulus 4 evaluated at s &#x3D; 1, and therefore the value β(1) of the Dirichlet beta function. 1735$$\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6}&#x3D;1+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{16}+\\cdots$$ The Basel problem is a problem in mathematical analysis with relevance to number theory, first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1650 and solved by Leonhard Euler in 1734, and read on 5 December 1735 in The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Since the problem had withstood the attacks of the leading mathematicians of the day, Euler’s solution brought him immediate fame when he was twenty-eight. Euler generalised the problem considerably, and his ideas were taken up years later by Bernhard Riemann in his seminal 1859 paper “On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude”, in which he defined his zeta function and proved its basic properties. The problem is named after Basel, hometown of Euler as well as of the Bernoulli family who unsuccessfully attacked the problem. The Basel problem asks for the precise summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers, i.e. the precise sum of the infinite series: $$\\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{2}}&#x3D;\\frac{1}{1^{2}}+\\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\\frac{1}{3^{2}}+\\cdots$$ The sum of the series is approximately equal to 1.644934. The Basel problem asks for the exact sum of this series (in closed form), as well as a proof that this sum is correct. Euler found the exact sum to be $\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6}$ and announced this discovery in 1735. His arguments were based on manipulations that were not justified at the time, although he was later proven correct. He produced a truly rigorous proof in 1741. 1737$$\\sum_{p_{n}} \\frac{1}{p_{n}}$$ Euler achieved the first major advance beyond Euclid’s proof by combining his method of generating functions with another highlight of ancient Greek number theory, unique factorization into primes. Theorem [Euler product for the zeta function]. The identity $$\\sum_{n&#x3D;1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{s}}&#x3D;\\prod_{p \\text { prime }} \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$ holds for all s such that the left-hand side converges absolutely. Proof : Here and henceforth we adopt the convention:The notation $\\prod_{p}$ or $\\sum_{p}$ means a product or sum over prime p. 1746$$\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial t^{2}}&#x3D;c^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}$$ The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of waves—as they occur in classical physics—such as mechanical waves (e.g. water waves, sound waves and seismic waves) or light waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. Historically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d’Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. In 1746, d’Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation. 1750$$V-E+F&#x3D;2$$ Euler formula: for any convex polyhedron, the number of vertices and faces together is exactly two more than the number of edges. Symbolically $V−E+F&#x3D;2$. For instance, a tetrahedron has four vertices, four faces, and six edges; $4-6+4&#x3D;2$. A version of the formula dates over 100 years earlier than Euler, to Descartes in 1630. Descartes gives a discrete form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, stating that the sum of the face angles of a polyhedron is $2π(V−2)$, from which he infers that the number of plane angles is $2F+2V-4$. The number of plane angles is always twice the number of edges, so this is equivalent to Euler’s formula, but later authors such as Lakatos, Malkevitch, and Polya disagree, feeling that the distinction between face angles and edges is too large for this to be viewed as the same formula. The formula $V−E+F&#x3D;2$ was (re)discovered by Euler; he wrote about it twice in 1750, and in 1752 published the result, with a faulty proof by induction for triangulated polyhedra based on removing a vertex and retriangulating the hole formed by its removal. The retriangulation step does not necessarily preserve the convexity or planarity of the resulting shape, so the induction does not go through. Another early attempt at a proof, by Meister in 1784, is essentially the triangle removal proof given here, but without justifying the existence of a triangle to remove. In 1794, Legendre provided a complete proof, using spherical angles. Cauchy got into the act in 1811, citing Legendre and adding incomplete proofs based on triangle removal, ear decomposition, and tetrahedron removal from a tetrahedralization of a partition of the polyhedron into smaller polyhedra. Hilton and Pederson provide more references as well as entertaining speculation on Euler’s discovery of the formula. 1760For a non-conservative force which depends on velocity, it may be possible to find a potential energy function V that depends on positions and velocities. If the generalized forces $Q_{i}$ can be derived from a potential V such that $$Q_{i}&#x3D;\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\dot{q} _{i}}-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q _{i}}$$ equating to Lagrange’s equations and defining the Lagrangian as $L &#x3D; T − V$ obtains Lagrange’s equations of the second kind or the Euler–Lagrange equations of motion $$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q _{i}}-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q} _{i}}&#x3D;0$$ However, the Euler–Lagrange equations can only account for non-conservative forces if a potential can be found as shown. This may not always be possible for non-conservative forces, and Lagrange’s equations do not involve any potential, only generalized forces; therefore they are more general than the Euler–Lagrange equations. The Euler–Lagrange equations also follow from the calculus of variations. The variation of the Lagrangian is $$\\delta L&#x3D;\\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q _{i}} \\delta q _{i}+\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q} _{i}} \\delta \\dot{q} _{i} \\right) \\ , \\quad \\delta \\dot{q} _{i} \\equiv \\delta \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q _{i}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\left( \\delta q _{i} \\right) }{\\mathrm{d} t} \\ ,$$ which has a form similar to the total differential of L, but the virtual displacements and their time derivatives replace differentials, and there is no time increment in accordance with the definition of the virtual displacements. An integration by parts with respect to time can transfer the time derivative of $\\delta q_{i}$ to the $\\partial L &#x2F; \\partial(\\mathrm{d} q_{i} &#x2F; \\mathrm{d} t)$, in the process exchanging $\\mathrm{d}\\left(\\delta q_{i}\\right) &#x2F; \\mathrm{d} t$ for $\\delta q_{i}$, allowing the independent virtual displacements to be factorized from the derivatives of the Lagrangian, $$\\int_{t_{1}} ^ {t_{2}} {\\delta L} {\\mathrm{~d} t} &#x3D; \\int_{t_{1}} ^ {t_{2}} \\sum_{i&#x3D;1} ^ {n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q _{i}} {\\delta q _{i}} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q} _{i}} {\\delta q _{i}} \\right) - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q} _{i}} {\\delta q _{i}} \\right) {\\mathrm{d} t}$$ $$&#x3D; \\sum_{i&#x3D;1} ^ {n} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial L} {\\partial \\dot{q} _{i}} {\\delta q _{i}} \\right] _{t _{1}} ^ {t _{2}} +$$ $$\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q _{i}} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q} _{i}} \\right) {\\delta q _{i}} {\\mathrm{~d} t} \\ .$$ Now, if the condition $\\delta q_{i}(t_{1}) &#x3D; \\delta q_{i}(t_{2}) &#x3D; 0$ holds for all i, the terms not integrated are zero. If in addition the entire time integral of $\\delta L$ is zero, then because the $\\delta q_{i}$ are independent, and the only way for a definite integral to be zero is if the integrand equals zero, each of the coefficients of $\\delta q_{i}$ must also be zero. Then we obtain the equations of motion. This can be summarized by Hamilton’s principle; $$\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \\delta L \\mathrm{~d} t&#x3D;0 \\ .$$ The time integral of the Lagrangian is another quantity called the action, defined as $$S&#x3D;\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} L \\mathrm{~d} t \\ ,$$ which is a functional; it takes in the Lagrangian function for all times between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ and returns a scalar value. Its dimensions are the same as [angular momentum], [energy]·[time], or [length]·[momentum]. With this definition Hamilton’s principle is $$\\delta S&#x3D;0 \\ .$$ Thus, instead of thinking about particles accelerating in response to applied forces, one might think of them picking out the path with a stationary action, with the end points of the path in configuration space held fixed at the initial and final times. Hamilton’s principle is sometimes referred to as the principle of least action, however the action functional need only be stationary, not necessarily a maximum or a minimum value. Any variation of the functional gives an increase in the functional integral of the action. 1799$$\\begin{array}{c}\\forall p(x) \\in \\mathbb{C}[x] \\\\exists z \\in \\mathbb{C}: p(z)&#x3D;0\\end{array}$$ The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.

StorylineLeonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are both brilliant physicists working at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California. They are colleagues, best friends, and roommates, although in all capacities their relationship is always tested primarily by Sheldon’s regimented, deeply eccentric, and non-conventional ways. They are also friends with their Cal Tech colleagues mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The foursome spend their time working on their individual work projects, playing video games, watching science-fiction movies, or reading comic books. As they are self-professed nerds, all have little or no luck with women. When Penny, a pretty woman and an aspiring actress from Omaha, moves into the apartment across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon’s, Leonard has another aspiration in life, namely to get Penny to be his girlfriend. Written by Huggo. 《生活大爆炸》是一部以科学天才为背景的情景喜剧，主人公是Leonard和Sheldon。 主人公Leonard和Sheldon是一对好朋友，他们的智商绝对高人一等，因为他们对量子物理学理论可以倒背如流，无论你问他们什么问题，都难不倒他们。但是说到日常生活，这两个不修边幅的男孩就彻底没了脾气，生活中柴米油盐这些看似简单的事情，却让他们有迷失在太空里一样的感觉，他们所掌握的那些科学原理在这里根本没有用武之地。直到有一天，隔壁搬来一位美貌性感的女孩Penny。顿时吸引了Leonard的目光。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Movie 影片","slug":"Movie-影片","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Movie-%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87/"}]},{"title":"Julia Roberts 👩‍🎤 朱莉娅·罗伯茨","slug":"2020-12-07-12-29-julia-roberts","date":"2020-12-07T04:29:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T04:18:04.890Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/07/2020-12-07-12-29-julia-roberts/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/07/2020-12-07-12-29-julia-roberts/","excerpt":"Julia Fiona Roberts was born in Smyrna, Georgia, to Betty Lou (Bredemus) and Walter Grady Roberts, one-time actors and playwrights, and is of English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.

As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, Eric Roberts, achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies Mystic Pizza (1988) and Satisfaction (1988). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia’s biggest success was in the signature movie Pretty Woman (1990), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People’s Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several actors, and married cinematographer Daniel Moder in 2002; the couple has three children together. 朱莉亚·罗伯茨，原名朱莉亚·菲奥纳·罗伯茨，1967年10月28日生于美国佐治亚州斯迈那市。从未想过要当美国人气最旺的女演员，童年时候，曾因酷爱动物，产生过当兽医的愿望，但后来学的是新闻专业。在好莱坞闯荡的哥哥埃里克·罗伯茨小有成绩之时，朱莉亚下决心前往好莱坞试试自己在表演方面的运气。1988年取得突破，在2部青年题材电影《现代灰姑娘和《满足中表现突出，迅速赢得一大批喜欢她的影迷。 茱莉娅出生于一个拥有爱尔兰血统的演艺家庭，父母都是演员，因此三个子女也相继踏上演艺之路。茱莉娅小时候跟哥哥一样曾患有口吃。四岁时，父母离异。高中毕业后便搬到纽约和姐姐一同实践追星梦，后来因为她哥哥艾力的帮助使她得到一个演出机会，但两人关系并不亲密。 罗伯茨毕业于亚特兰大大学新闻学系。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Star 明星","slug":"Star-明星","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Star-%E6%98%8E%E6%98%9F/"}]},{"title":"Brad Pitt 🧔🏻‍♂️ 布拉德·皮特","slug":"2020-12-07-11-48-brad-pitt","date":"2020-12-07T03:48:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T04:18:54.051Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/12/07/2020-12-07-11-48-brad-pitt/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/12/07/2020-12-07-11-48-brad-pitt/","excerpt":"William Brad Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri.

Pitt has an interest in art, learned pottery, and has created sculptures. Nine of his sculptures were exhibited together with works by musician Nick Cave and artist Thomas Houseago at the Sara Hildén Art Museum in Tampere, Finland in 2022-2023.

As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world’s human population, especially in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize. Rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide. The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound irrigation planning but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. 稻，又称稻谷、稻米，俗称大米，常简称为米，是人类重要的粮食作物之一。 稻耕种及食用的历史相当悠久，分为水稻和光稃稻。 稻的栽培起源于约西元前8200年南中国珠江中游的聚落地带，另有考古发现在约西元前8200年前的中国湖南也有种早期稻米。 在1993年，考古队在道县玉蟾岩发现了世界最早的古栽培稻，距今约8200年。 水稻在中国与东南亚广为栽种后，逐渐向西传播到印度，在亚洲季风气候区是自古以来的主食，中世纪时引入欧洲南部。 现时全世界有一半的人口食用稻，主要在亚洲、欧洲南部和热带美洲及非洲部分地区。 2013年稻的总产量占世界粮食作物产量第二位，仅低于玉米。 籼稻（Oryza sativa indica）：有20%左右为直链淀粉。属中黏性。籼稻起源于亚热带，种植于热带和亚热带地区，生长期短，在无霜期长的地方一年可多次成熟。去壳成为籼米后，外观细长、透明度低。有的品种表皮发红，如中国江西出产的红米，煮熟后米饭较干、松。通常用于萝卜糕、米粉、炒饭。广东人爱吃的丝苗米是籼稻的一种。为南亚、东南亚、中国南部地区主要食用米。 粳稻（Oryza sativa japonica）：粳稻的直链淀粉较少，低于15%。种植于温带和寒带地区，生长期长，一般一年只能成熟一次，台湾一般被认为是北半球粳稻生长最南区。去壳成为粳米后，外观圆短、透明（部分品种米粒有局部白粉质）。煮食特性介于糯米与籼米之间。为中国北部及台湾、日本、朝鲜半岛主要食用米。 糯稻（Oryza sativa var glutinosa）：支链淀粉含量接近100%，黏性最高。又分粳糯(圆糯)及籼糯(长糯)，粳糯外观圆短，籼糯外观细长，颜色均为白色不透明。煮熟后米饭较软、黏。粳糯常见用途为用于酿酒、米糕、红龟粿、甜粿、汤圆等。籼糯则作为八宝粥、粽子、油饭等原料。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Food 食品","slug":"Food-食品","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Food-%E9%A3%9F%E5%93%81/"}]},{"title":"Korean 🇰🇷 공부하다 1","slug":"2020-11-25-15-52-korean-1","date":"2020-11-25T07:52:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:55:37.139Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-52-korean-1/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-52-korean-1/","excerpt":"Sejong Korean 1한국어와 한글한국어 한국어는 한국의 공용어이다. 한국어를 사용하는 인구는 한반도에 거주하는 인구와 해외 한국계 한국어는 사용 인구로 볼 때 세계 13위 안에 드는 언어이다. 언어별 인터넷 사용자 수 순위에서 한국어 사용자는 세계 10위 안에 든다.","text":"Sejong Korean 1한국어와 한글한국어 한국어는 한국의 공용어이다. 한국어를 사용하는 인구는 한반도에 거주하는 인구와 해외 한국계 한국어는 사용 인구로 볼 때 세계 13위 안에 드는 언어이다. 언어별 인터넷 사용자 수 순위에서 한국어 사용자는 세계 10위 안에 든다. 한글 한글은 한국어를 표기하는 문자이다. 한글은 세종대왕이 1443년에 창제하였다. 그때 이름은 훈민정음 이었다. 한글 창제 이전에는 지식인층을 중심으로 한자로 문자 생활을 하였으나, 한글이 창제되면서 일반 사람들도 문자 생활이 가능해졌다. 한글과 한국어는 엄연히 다릅니다. 우리가 지금 말하는 언어는 ‘한국어’입니다. 이 ‘한국어’를 표기하는 문자가 ‘한글’인 것이구요. 미국 사람들이 말하는 것은 ‘영어’입니다. 이 ‘영어’를 표기하는 문자가 ‘알파벳(로마자)인 것이구요. 즉, 한글,한국어,영어,알파벳의 관계를 살펴보면 이렇습니다. 한국어를 한글로 쓴 경우 (안녕하세요.) 한국어를 알파벳으로 쓴 경우 (An nyeong ha se yo.) 영어를 한글로 쓴 경우 (헬로우!) 영어를 알파벳으로 쓴 경우 (Hello!) 결국 세종대왕이 한글을 창제하기 이전에 우리들의 언어는 한국어였습니다. 다만 이 한국어를 표기할 문자가 없었기 때문에 한문을 이용한 것입니다. 그런데 이 한문이 너무 어렵고 우리 한국어를 표기하는데 적합하지 않다고 생각하여 세종대왕께서 한글창제를 기획하신 것입니다.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Language 语言","slug":"Language-语言","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Language-%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80/"}]},{"title":"Korean 🇰🇷 공부하다 2","slug":"2020-11-25-15-43-korean-2","date":"2020-11-25T07:43:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:55:48.867Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-43-korean-2/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/25/2020-11-25-15-43-korean-2/","excerpt":"Sejong Korean 2한글 자모자모와 음절 교착어(膠着語): 실질적인 의미를 가진 단어 또는 어간에 문법적인 기능을 가진 요소가 붙어 쓰이는 언어. 한국어·일본어·터키어·핀란드어 따위. &lt;동의어&gt;

The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy. A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death. Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness. The series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal, but at the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that as a baby, his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school’s potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry’s confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher’s Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describes Harry’s second year at Hogwarts. Students are attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle parentage are the primary targets. The attacks appear related to the Chamber of Secrets, a fifty-year-old mystery at the school. Harry discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which he learns is rare and associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione is attacked, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber’s secrets and enter it. Harry discovers that the chamber was opened by Ron’s younger sister, Ginny Weasley, who was possessed by an old diary in her belongings. The memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort’s younger self, resided inside the diary and unleashed the basilisk, an ancient monster that kills those who make direct eye contact. Harry draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, slays the basilisk and destroys the diary. In the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted by Sirius Black, an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his parents’ murder. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – creatures guarding the school that feed on despair – he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a black dog into the Shrieking Shack; Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed to be Sirius Black. Lupin enters the shack and explains that Black was James Potter’s best friend; he was framed by Peter Pettigrew, who hides as Ron’s pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin transforms into a werewolf and bounds away; the group chase after him but are surrounded by dementors. They are saved by a mysterious figure who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a future version of Harry, who traveled back in time with Hermione using the Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a Hippogriff.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Literature 文学","slug":"Literature-文学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Literature-%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Slang Words 🤙 俚语","slug":"2020-11-19-01-56-slang-words","date":"2020-11-18T17:56:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T03:49:32.604Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/19/2020-11-19-01-56-slang-words/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/19/2020-11-19-01-56-slang-words/","excerpt":"Slang is language of an informal register that members of particular in-groups prefer over the common vocabulary of a standard language in order to establish group identity, exclude outsiders, or both.

Individuals on the brink of insolvency also restructure their debt as do countries that are heading for a default on sovereign debt. The debt restructuring process can reduce the interest rates on loans or extend the due dates for a company’s liabilities. A debt restructure might include a debt-for-equity swap, in which creditors agree to cancel a portion or all of the outstanding debt in exchange for equity. A nation seeking to restructure its debt might move its debt from the private sector to public sector institutions. Some companies seek to restructure their debt when they are facing bankruptcy. A company might restructure several loans so that some are subordinate in priority to other loans. Senior debtholders are paid before the lenders of subordinated debts if the company files for bankruptcy. Creditors are sometimes willing to alter debt terms to avoid potential bankruptcy or default. The debt restructuring process typically involves reducing the interest rates on loans, extending the dates when the company’s liabilities are due to be paid, or both. These steps improve the firm’s chances of paying back the obligations. Creditors understand that they would receive even less should the company be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Debt restructuring can be a win-win for both entities because the business avoids bankruptcy, and the lenders typically receive more than what they would through a bankruptcy proceeding. Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: Debt restructuring means lenders get paid back less or get paid back over a longer time frame or at a lower interest rate that was first agreed. Somehow a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt. Lenders would rather have a little of something than all of nothing. Even though debt disappears, debt restructuring causes income and asset values to disappear faster, so the debt burden continues to gets worse. Like cutting spending, debt reduction is also painful and deflationary. All of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment means the government collects fewer taxes. At the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen. Many of the unemployed have inadequate savings and need financial support from the government. Additionally, governments create stimulus plans and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy. Governments’ budget deficits explode in a deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes. This is what is happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news. To fund their deficits, governments need to either raise taxes or borrow money. But with incomes falling and so many unemployed, who is the money going to come from? The rich. Since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people, governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy - from the ‘haves’ to the ‘have nots’. The ‘have-nots,’ who are suffering, begin to resent the wealthy ‘haves.’ The wealthy ‘haves,’ being squeezed by the weak economy, falling asset prices, higher taxes, begin to resent the ‘have nots.’ If the depression continues social disorder can break out. Not only do tensions rise within countries, they can rise between countries - especially debtor and creditor countries. This situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme. In the 1930s, this led to Hitler coming to power, war in Europe, and depression in the United States. Pressure to do something to end the depression increases. Remember, most of what people thought was money was actually credit. So, when credit disappears, people don’t have enough money. People are desperate for money and you remember who can print money? The Central Bank can. Having already lowered its interest rates to nearly 0 - it’s forced to print money. Unlike cutting spending, debt reduction, and wealth redistribution, printing money is inflationary and stimulative. Inevitably, the central bank prints new money — out of thin air — and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds. It happened in the United States during the Great Depression and again in 2008, when the United States’ central bank — the Federal Reserve — printed over two trillion dollars. Other central banks around the world that could, printed a lot of money, too. By buying financial assets with this money, it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more creditworthy. However, this only helps those who own financial assets. You see, the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets. The Central Government, on the other hand, can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people but it can’t print money. So, in order to stimulate the economy, the two must cooperate. By buying government bonds, the Central Bank essentially lends money to the government, allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending on goods and services through its stimulus programs and unemployment benefits. This increases people’s income as well as the government’s debt. However, it will lower the economy’s total debt burden. This is a very risky time. Policy makers need to balance the four ways that debt burdens come down. The deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in order to maintain stability. If balanced correctly, there can be a Beautiful Deleveraging. You see, a deleveraging can be ugly or it can be beautiful. How can a deleveraging be beautiful? Even though a deleveraging is a difficult situation, handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful. A lot more beautiful than the debt-fueled, unbalanced excesses of the leveraging phase. In a beautiful deleveraging, debts decline relative to income, real economic growth is positive, and inflation isn’t a problem. It is achieved by having the right balance. The right balance requires a certain mix of cutting spending, reducing debt, transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained. People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won’t if it offsets falling credit. Remember, spending is what matters. A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on price as a dollar of spending paid for with credit. By printing money, the Central Bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money. In order to turn things around, the Central Bank needs to not only pump up income growth but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the accumulated debt. So, what do I mean by that? Basically, income needs to grow faster than debt grows. For example: let’s assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to- income ratio of 100%. That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year. Now think about the interest rate on that debt, let’s say it is 2%. If debt is growing at 2% because of that interest rate and income is only growing at around only 1%, you will never reduce the debt burden. You need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the rate of interest. However, printing money can easily be abused because it’s so easy to do and people prefer it to the alternatives. The key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptably high inflation, the way Germany did during its deleveraging in the 1920’s. If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn’t so dramatic. Growth is slow but debt burdens go down. That’s a beautiful deleveraging. When incomes begin to rise, borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy. And when borrowers appear more creditworthy, lenders begin to lend money again. Debt burdens finally begin to fall. Able to borrow money, people can spend more. Eventually, the economy begins to grow again, leading to the reflation phase of the long term debt cycle. Though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly, if handled well, it will eventually fix the problem. It takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal - hence the term ‘lost decade.’ Of course, the economy is a little more complicated than this template suggests. However, laying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycle and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we’ve been, where we are now and where we are probably headed. So in summary, there are three rules of thumb that I’d like you to take away from this: First: Don’t have debt rise faster than income, because your debt burdens will eventually crush you. Second: Don’t have income rise faster than productivity, because you will eventually become uncompetitive. And third: Do all that you can to raise your productivity, because, in the long run, that’s what matters most. This is simple advice for you and it’s simple advice for policy makers.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"Inflation 💵 通货膨胀","slug":"2020-11-15-17-30-inflation","date":"2020-11-15T09:30:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-29T06:31:02.829Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/15/2020-11-15-17-30-inflation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/15/2020-11-15-17-30-inflation/","excerpt":"Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time.

Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when the purchasing power of money increases and prices decline. Inflation is the rate at which the the value of a currency is falling and consequently the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. Inflation is sometimes classified into three types: Demand-Pull inflation, Cost-Push inflation, and Built-In inflation. Most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Inflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint and rate of change. Those with tangible assets, like property or stocked commodities, may like to see some inflation as that raises the value of their assets. People holding cash may not like inflation, as it erodes the value of their cash holdings. Ideally, an optimum level of inflation is required to promote spending to a certain extent instead of saving, thereby nurturing economic growth. Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: In an economy without credit: the only way to increase your spending is to produce more. But in an economy with credit, you can also increase your spending by borrowing. As a result, an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run, but not over the long run. Now, don’t get me wrong, credit isn’t necessarily something bad that just causes cycles. It’s bad when it finances over-consumption that can’t be paid back. However, it’s good when it efficiently allocates resources and produces income so you can pay back the debt. For example, if you borrow money to buy a big TV, it doesn’t generate income for you to pay back the debt. But, if you borrow money to buy a tractor — and that tractor let’s you harvest more crops and earn more money — then, you can pay back your debt and improve your living standards. In an economy with credit, we can follow the transactions and see how credit creates growth. Let me give you an example: Suppose you earn $100,000 a year and have no debt. You are creditworthy enough to borrow $10,000 dollars - say on a credit card - so you can spend $110,000 dollars even though you only earn $100,000 dollars. Since your spending is another person’s income, someone is earning $110,000 dollars. The person earning $110,000 dollars with no debt can borrow $11,000 dollars, so he can spend $121,000 dollars even though he has only earned $110,000 dollars. His spending is another person’s income and by following the transactions we can begin to see how this process works in a self-reinforcing pattern. But remember, borrowing creates cycles and if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down. This leads us into the Short Term Debt Cycle. As economic activity increases, we see an expansion - the first phase of the short term debt cycle. Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise. This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit - which can be created instantly out of thin air. When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods: prices rise. When prices rise, we call this inflation. The Central Bank doesn’t want too much inflation because it causes problems. Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates. With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money. And the cost of existing debts rises. Think about this as the monthly payments on your credit card going up. Because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments, they have less money leftover to spend, so spending slows and since one person’s spending is another person’s income, incomes drop and so on and so forth. When people spend less, prices go down. We call this deflation. Economic activity decreases and we have a recession. If the recession becomes too severe and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again. With low interest rates, debt repayments are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up and we see another expansion. As you can see, the economy works like a machine. In the short term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there’s an economic expansion. When credit isn’t easily available, there’s a recession. And note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank. The short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 - 8 years and happens over and over again for decades. But notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt. Why? Because people push it — they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt. It’s human nature. Because of this, over long periods of time, debts rise faster than incomes creating the Long Term Debt Cycle. Despite people becoming more indebted, lenders even more freely extend credit. Why? Because everybody thinks things are going great! People are just focusing on what’s been happening lately. And what has been happening lately? Incomes have been rising! Asset values are going up! The stock market roars! It’s a boom! It pays to buy goods, services, and financial assets with borrowed money! When people do a lot of that, we call it a bubble. So even though debts have been growing, incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them. Let’s call the ratio of debt-to-income the debt burden. So long as incomes continue to rise, the debt burden stays manageable. At the same time asset values soar. People borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher. People feel wealthy. So even with the accumulation of lots of debt, rising incomes and asset values help borrowers remain creditworthy for a long time. But this obviously can not continue forever. And it doesn’t. Over decades, debt burdens slowly increase creating larger and larger debt repayments. At some point, debt repayments start growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending. And since one person’s spending is another person’s income, incomes begin to go down which makes people less creditworthy causing borrowing to go down. Debt repayments continue to rise which makes spending drop even further and the cycle reverses itself. This is the long term debt peak. Debt burdens have simply become too big. For the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world this happened in 2008. It happened for the same reason it happened in Japan in 1989 and in the United States back in 1929. Now the economy begins Deleveraging. In a deleveraging; people cut spending, incomes fall, credit disappears, assets prices drop, banks get squeezed, the stock market crashes, social tensions rise and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way. As incomes fall and debt repayments rise, borrowers get squeezed. No longer creditworthy, credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt repayments. Scrambling to fill this hole, borrowers are forced to sell assets. The rush to sell assets floods the market. This is when the stock market collapses, the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble. As asset prices drop, the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops. This makes borrowers even less creditworthy. People feel poor. Credit rapidly disappears. Less spending › less income › less wealth › less credit › less borrowing and so on. It’s a vicious cycle. This appears similar to a recession but the difference here is that interest rates can’t be lowered to save the day. In a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate the borrowing. However, in a deleveraging, lowering interest rates doesn’t work because interest rates are already low and soon hit 0% - so the stimulation ends. Interest rates in the United States hit 0% during the deleveraging of the 1930s and again in 2008. The difference between a recession and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging borrowers’ debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can’t be relieved by lowering interest rates. Lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back. Borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value. They feel crippled by the debt - they don’t even want more! Lenders stop lending. Borrowers stop borrowing. Think of the economy as being not-creditworthy, just like an individual. So what do you do about a deleveraging? The problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down. There are four ways this can happen: people, businesses, and governments cut their spending. debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings. wealth is redistributed from the ‘haves’ to the ‘have nots’. and finally, the central bank prints new money. These 4 ways have happened in every deleveraging in modern history. Usually, spending is cut first. As we just saw, people, businesses, banks and even governments tighten their belts and cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt. This is often referred to as austerity. When borrowers stop taking on new debts, and start paying down old debts, you might expect the debt burden to decrease. But the opposite happens! Because spending is cut - and one man’s spending is another man’s income - it causes incomes to fall. They fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse. As we’ve seen, this cut in spending is deflationary and painful. Businesses are forced to cut costs which means less jobs and higher unemployment. This leads to the next step: debts must be reduced! Many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans — and a borrower’s debts are a lender’s assets. When borrowers don’t repay the bank, people get nervous that the bank won’t be able to repay them so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank. Banks get squeezed and people, businesses and banks default on their debts. This severe economic contraction is a depression.

But in business bookkeeping, this plain definition can get complicated. A transaction will be recorded earlier or later depending on whether the company uses accrual accounting rather than cash accounting. The accrual accounting method requires a transaction to be recorded when it occurs, regardless of when the money is received or the expenses are paid. The cash accounting method records a transaction only when the money is received or the expenses are paid. This may require a letter of intent or a memorandum of understanding. Accrual accounting is used by businesses with gross receipts above $1 million a year, while the cash accounting method is used by most small businesses. Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: An economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing. You make transactions all the time. Every time you buy something you create a transaction. Each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods, services or financial assets. Credit spends just like money, so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent, you can know the total spending. The total amount of spending drives the economy. If you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold, you get the price. And that’s it. That’s a transaction. It is the building block of the economic machine. All cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions. So, if we can understand transactions, we can understand the whole economy. A market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing. For example, there is a wheat market, a car market, a stock market and markets for millions of things. An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets. If you add up the total spending and the total quantity sold in all of the markets, you have everything you need to know to understand the economy. It’s just that simple. People, businesses, banks and governments all engage in transactions the way I just described: exchanging money and credit for goods, services and financial assets. The biggest buyer and seller is the government, which consists of two important parts: a Central Government that collects taxes and spends money and a Central Bank, which is different from other buyers and sellers because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy. It does this by influencing interest rates and printing new money. For these reasons, as we’ll see, the Central Bank is an important player in the flow of Credit.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"Principles for Success 🎯 成功的原理（1-4）","slug":"2020-11-13-13-36-principles-for-success-1-4","date":"2020-11-13T05:36:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T04:01:29.274Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-36-principles-for-success-1-4/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-36-principles-for-success-1-4/","excerpt":"by Ray Dalio The Call to Adventure Before we begin, let me just establish the fact that I don’t know much relative to what I need to know.

Whatever success I’ve had in life has more to do with my knowing how to deal with my not knowing than anything I know. That I should be telling other people what to do sounds kind of presumptuous to me. But I’m going to do it because I believe that the principles that have made me successful could help other achieve their own goals. I’m now at a stage in my own life in which it is much more important to me to pass along what I’ve learned about how to be successful than to seek more success for myself. What you choose to do with these principles is up to you. You have to be an independent thinker because only you can develop your own principles based on your own values. This brings me to my first and most fundamental principle which is that you need to think for yourself about what is true. So let’s get started. Early on, I’ve discovered I needed principles. Principles are smart ways for handling things that happen over and over again in similar situations. There are principles for everything. From skiing, to parenting, to cooking, and so on. I’m going to share some of my most important overarching life principles that influence how we approach everything that we do. I didn’t start out with principles, I acquired them over a lifetime of experiences. Mostly from making mistakes and reflecting on them. My life principles are simple but they’re not complete. I still struggle to make the best decisions and I still make mistakes and learn new principles all the time. This is the reality. At the beginning, I needed to escape the conventions that surrounded me which meant that I needed to think for myself. Unless you want to have a life that is directed by others, you need to decide for yourself what to do and you need to have the courage to do it. But I didn’t know that at first. I only learned that from going on my adventure. Looking back on my own journey, I now see that time is like a river, that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can’t stop our movement down this river and we can’t avoid the encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way. In your lifetime, you will face millions of decisions. The quality of your decisions will determine the quality of your life. Over the course of my lifetime, the most valuable things I’ve learned were the results of mistakes I’ve reflected on to help form principles so I wouldn’t make the same mistakes again. These principles took me from being a very ordinary middle-class kid from Long Island to becoming very successful as judged by conventional measures. They also gave me the meaningful work and meaningful relationships that I value even more than these conventional successes. People often ask me how I did it. I can assure you it wasn’t because of my uniqueness as a person. It was the result of a unique approach to life I believe almost anybody can adopt. It starts with embracing reality and dealing with it. Embrace Reality and Deal With ItThe path you take in life is your most important decision. In my case, I wanted my life to be great and I feared boredom and mediocrity more than I feared failure. Since I didn’t start out with money, and I didn’t need much more than a bed to sleep in and food to eat, I could skew my decisions to pursue my adventures. So ever since I was a kid, I ran after the things I wanted, crashed, got up and ran again, and crashed again. And each time I crashed I learned something, got better, and crashed less. By doing that over and over again, I learned to love this process, even the crashing part of it. Through it, I encountered reality, and I learned how to deal with it, which inspired another one of my most fundamental principles which is that truth is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes. By truth, I don’t mean anything more than the way the world works. I believe that we were given the laws of reality by nature. Humans didn’t create them, but we can use them to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals. Realizing that made me a hyperrealist, by which I mean I became someone who has discovered the great rewards of deeply understanding, accepting, and working with reality as it is and not as I wish it would be. When I say I’m a hyperrealist, people sometimes think I’m saying that dreams can’t come true. That’s absolutely not true. Without pursuing dreams, life is mundane. What I mean is that to me, hyperrealism is the best way to choose one’s dreams and then achieve them. Having big dreams plus embracing reality plus having lots of determination will bring you a successful life. I believe this formula is true for everyone, but what does a successful life look like? We each have to decide for ourselves what success is. I don’t care whether you want to be a master of the universe or to live under a palm tree or anything else. I really don’t. Each of us chooses goals based on our values and decides on the best path to achieve them, but we all need approaches to making decisions that work well, especially when facing problems, mistakes, and weaknesses that stand in our way. To succeed, we must embrace all our realities, especially the harsh realities that we wish weren’t true. At first, looking at these harsh realities caused me a lot of pain, but I learned that this pain was just psychological and that by seeing things differently made all the difference. I came to view problems like puzzles that would reward me if I could solve them. They would help me deal with the problem at hand, and they would give me principles for dealing with similar problems in the future. I learned to treat pain as a cue that a great learning opportunity is at hand, which led me to realize that pain plus reflection equals progress. Meditation has been invaluable in helping me see things that way. I found that when I calmed myself down and embraced my realities and dealt with them, the rewards brought me pleasure and the pain faded. Each of us has the unique capability to think logically to reflect on ourselves and our circumstances and to direct our own personal evolution. Doing this well is just a matter of following a simple five-step process. The Five Step ProcessWe’ve discussed how important it is to reflect carefully after experiencing pain. When I did this, I was usually able to discover principles that would prevent me from repeating the same mistakes in the future, and I could see that being successful simply consisted of five steps. Step one is to know your goals and run after them. What is best for you depends on your nature, so you need to really understand yourself and know what you want to achieve in life. Step two is to encounter the problems that stand in the way of getting to your goals. These problems are typically painful. If handled badly, some of them can lead to your ruin. But to evolve, you need to identify those problems and not tolerate them. Step three is to diagnose these problems to get at their root causes. Don’t jump too quickly to solutions. Take a step back and reflect in order to really distinguish the symptoms from the disease. Step four is to design a plan to eliminate the problems. This is where you will determine what you need to do to get around them. And step five is to execute those designs, pushing yourself to do what’s needed to progress towards your goal. A successful life essentially consists of doing these five steps over and over again. This is your personal evolution, and you see this process everywhere. It’s just a law of nature. Think of any product, any organization, or any person you know, and you will see that this is true for them. Evolution is simply a process of either adapting or dying. Conceptually, it looks just like the five step process I’ve described. As you push through this often painful process, you’ll naturally ascend to higher and higher levels of success. I’ve found that when I did it better, my struggling never became easier because the more capable I became, the greater the challenges I would take on. Because different people are strong and weak at different things, most people can’t do all five steps well. Not facing this reality means you could stretch further than you should, and as the heights get greater, your falls could also be greater. Sometimes terrible things happen to all of us in life. They can ruin us, or they can profoundly improve us, depending on how we handle them. Something like this happened to me in 1982. The AbyssWe progress forward until we encounter setbacks. Whether or not we get out of them and continue forward or spiral downward depends on whether or not we’re willing to face the failure objectively and make the right decisions to turn the loop upward again. Something terrible happened to me in 1982, when I bet everything on a depression that never came. The period between 1979 and 1982 was one of extreme turbulence. For the global economy, the markets, and for me. And I believed that the U.S. economy, with the world economy tied to it, was headed toward a catastrophe. This view was extremely controversial. I wanted the great upside and very publicly took a big risk and was wrong. Dead wrong. After a delay, the stock market began a big bull market that lasted 18 years and the U.S. economy enjoyed the greatest growth period in its history. This experience was like a blow to my head with a baseball bat. I had to cut my losses so that my company, Bridgewater, was left with one employee: Me. I was so broke, I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad to pay my bills, but even worse was having to let go the people I cared so much about. I wondered whether I should give up my dream of working for myself and play it safe by working for someone else in a job that would require me to put on a tie and commute every day. Though I knew that, for me, taking less risk would mean having a less great life. Being so wrong, and especially being so publicly wrong, was painfully humbling. I am still shocked and embarrassed by how arrogant I was in being totally confident in a totally incorrect view. Though I’d been right much more than I’d been wrong, I had let one bad bet erase all my good ones. I thought very hard about the relationship between risk and reward and how to manage them, but I couldn’t see a path forward that would give me the rewards I wanted without unacceptable risk. This kind of experience happens to everyone. It will happen to you. You will lose something or someone you think you can’t live without. Or you will suffer a terrible illness or injury. Or your career will fall apart before your eyes. You might think that your life is ruined and that there’s no way to go forward, but it will pass. I assure you that there is always a best path forward and you probably just don’t see it yet. You just have to reflect well to find it. You have to embrace your reality.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Life 人生","slug":"Life-人生","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Life-%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F/"}]},{"title":"Principles for Success 🎯 成功的原理（5-8）","slug":"2020-11-13-13-29-principles-for-success-5-8","date":"2020-11-13T05:29:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-30T03:59:48.046Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-29-principles-for-success-5-8/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/13/2020-11-13-13-29-principles-for-success-5-8/","excerpt":"by Ray Dalio Everything is a MachineSometimes things happen that are hard to understand.

So I thought a lot about how things work, which helped to put me and my own circumstances in perspective. I saw that at the Big Bang, all the laws and forces of the universe were created and propelled forward, interacting with each other as a perpetual motion machine in which all the bits and pieces coalesce into machines that work for awhile, fall apart, and then coalesce into new machines. This goes on into eternity. I saw that everything is a machine. The structure and evolution of galaxies, the formation of our own solar system, the makeup of Earth’s geography and ecosystems, our economies and markets, and each of us, we individually are machines made up of different machines, our circulatory system, our nervous system that produce our thoughts, our dreams, our emotions, and all the other aspects of our distinct characters. All of these different machines evolve together through time to produce the realities we encounter every day. And I realized that I was just one tiny bit in one nanosecond deciding what I should do. While that perspective might sound very philosophical, I found that it was very practical because it showed me how I could deal with my own realities in a better way. For example, I observed that most everything happens over and over again in slightly different ways, some in obvious short term cycles that are easy to recognize so we know how to deal with them, like the 24 hour day, some so infrequently that they haven’t occurred in our lifetimes, and we’re shocked when they do, like the once in a hundred year storm, and some we know exist but are encountering for the first time, like the birth of our first child. Most people mistakenly treat these situations as being unique and deal with them without having proper perspective or principles to help them get through them. I found that if instead of dealing with these events as one offs, I could see each as just another one of those and approach them in the same way a biologist might approach an animal, first identifying its species, then drawing on principles for dealing with it appropriately. Because I could see these events transpire in pretty much the same ways over and over, I could more clearly see the cause-effect relationships that govern their behaviors, which allowed me to develop better principles that I could express in both words and algorithms. I learned that while most everyone expects the future to be a slightly modified version of the present, it is typically very different. That’s because people are biased by recent history and overlook events that haven’t happened in a long time, perhaps not even in their lifetime, but they will happen again. With that perspective, I realize that what I missed when I mistakenly called for a Great Depression was hidden in the patterns of history and I could use my newfound knowledge of these patterns to make better decisions in the future. And when I thought about my challenge balancing risk and reward, I realized that risk and reward naturally go together. I could see that to get the most out of life, one has to take more risks and that knowing how to appropriately balance risk and reward is essential to having the best life possible. Imagine you are faced with a choice of having a safe boring life if you stay where you are or having a fabulous one if you take the risk of successfully crossing a dangerous jungle. That is essentially the choice we all face. For me, the choice was clear, but that doesn’t mean the path forward was without challenges. I still needed to face two big barriers that we all must face. Your Two Biggest BarriersI can’t tell you which path in life is best for you because I don’t know how important it is for you to achieve big goals relative to how important it is for you to avoid the pains required to get them. This is the courage I spoke of earlier and we each have to feel these things out for ourselves. After my big mistake in calling for a depression, I had come to one of life’s forks in the road as we all do. If I made the choice to take a normal job and play it safe, I would have ended up with a very different life than the one I had. But as long as I can pay the rent, put food on the table, and educate my kids, the only choice for me was to risk crossing the jungle in pursuit of the best life possible. My big mistake in betting on a depression gave me a healthy fear of being wrong, in other words, it gave me deep humility, which was exactly what I needed. At the same time, it didn’t stop me from aggressively going after the things I wanted. To succeed, I needed to see more than I alone can see. But standing in my way of doing that were the two biggest barriers everyone faces: our ego and blind spot barriers. These barriers exist because of how our brains work. First, let’s explore the ego barrier. When I refer to your ego barrier, I’m talking about the parts of your brain that prevent you from acknowledging your weaknesses objectively so that you can figure out how to deal with it. Your deepest-seated needs and fears reside in areas of your brain that control your emotions and are not accessible to your higher level conscious awareness and because our need to be right can be more important than our need to find out what’s true, we like to believe our own opinions without properly stress testing them. We especially don’t like to look at our mistakes and weaknesses. We are instinctively prone to react to explorations of them as though they’re attacks. We get angry, even though it would be more logical for us to be open to feedback from others. This leads to our making inferior decisions, learning less, and falling short of our potentials. The second is the blind spot barrier. Everyone has blind spots. The blind spot barrier is when a person believes he or she can see everything, but it’s a simple fact that no one alone can see a complete picture of reality. Naturally people can’t appreciate what they can’t see, just as we all have different ranges for singing, hearing pitch, and seeing colors, we have different ranges for seeing and understanding things. For example, while some people are better at seeing the big picture, others excel at seeing details. Some are linear thinkers and others are more lateral. While some are creative but not reliable, others are reliable but not creative, and so on. Because of how our brains are wired differently, everyone perceives the world around them differently. By doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weaknesses and we crash. Either we keep doing that or we change. Aristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person’s fatal flaw. A flaw that, had it been fixed, would have instead led to a wonderful outcome. In my opinion, these two barriers are the main impediments that get in the way of good decision-making. My fear of being wrong gave me the radical open-mindedness I needed and that changed everything. Be Radically Open-MindedTaking risks and occasionally being ruined wasn’t acceptable, and neither was not taking risks, and not having exceptional results. I needed an approach that would give me the exceptional upside without also giving me the exceptional downside. When I discovered it, it turned out to be my holy grail. To get it, I needed to replace the joy of being proven right with the joy of learning what’s true. This need prompted me to seek out the most thoughtful people I could find who disagreed with me. I didn’t care about their conclusions, I just wanted to see things through their eyes, and to have them see things through my eyes, so that together, we could hash things out to discover what’s true. In other words, what I wanted most from them was thoughtful disagreement, going from seeing things through just my eyes to seeing things through the eyes of these thoughtful people was like going from seeing things in black and white to seeing them in color. The world lit up! That’s when I realized that the best way to go through the jungle of life is with insightful people who see things differently from me. Think about the five step process I described earlier. As I said, because we are wired so differently, not everyone can do all the five steps well, but you don’t have to do them all alone. You can get help from others who are good at what you’re not, who are wired to perceive things you can’t. All you need to do is let go of your attachment to having the right answers yourself, and use your fear of being wrong to become open-minded to these other views. In this way, you could point out the risks and opportunities that you would individually miss. I found that taking this radically open-minded approach and believability weighting people’s thinking significantly increased my probabilities of making the best decisions possible. This enabled me to ascend to greater heights and greater challenges. In the past, I would have always wanted to do what I myself thought was best, but now I sought out the strongest independent thinkers I could find, I still do. There is nothing better to be on shared mission with extraordinary people who can be radically truthful, and radically transparent with each other. This approach led me to create a company with a unique idea meritocracy, operating in a unique way that produced unique successes. In an idea meritocracy, you get the best of everybody. Everyone thinks independently, then we work through our disagreements to get at what’s best. However, not every opinion is equally valuable, and we had to learn to distinguish between good ideas and bad ones to get the best decisions. In other words, we needed to believability weight people’s thinking. But that’s another story I will explain in my work principles. Right now, there are many wonderful opportunities and dangerous risks surrounding you that you don’t see. If you saw them free of the distortions produced by your ego or your blind spots, you would be able to deal with them more effectively. If you could acquire this ability, and with practice you can, you will radically improve your life. Struggle WellSo far, I described how I learned to confront my own realities, my problems, my mistakes and weaknesses, and how I surrounded myself with others who could do things better than I could. This was the most effective way I discovered for making great decisions. This is not the normal way of being but through this approach, I became very successful. And being successful enabled me to meet extraordinarily successful people and see how they think. I’ve discovered that their journeys were similar to mine. You might not know it but they all struggle and they all have weaknesses. That they all get around by working with people who see risks and opportunities that they would miss. Over time, I learned that by nature most people’s greatest strengths are also connected to their most significant weaknesses. And striving hard for big things is bound to lead you to painful falls. It’s just part of the process. Such setbacks will test you. They sort people. Some think hard about what caused their setbacks, learned lessons, and continue progressing toward their goals. While others decide that this game is not for them and get off the field, I’ve come to realize that success is not a matter of attaining one’s goals. I found that when I reached each new higher level of success, I really remained satisfied. The things we’re striving for are just the bait. Struggling to get them forces us to evolve. And it is this struggle to our personal evolution with others that is the reward. I no longer wanted to get across the jungle but instead wanted to find greater and greater challenges to go after. Surrounded by great people working together on a shared journey. Eventually, the success of the mission and the well-being of the people alongside me became more important than my own success. I also started to see beyond myself and wanted others to be successful when I’m no longer here. I realized that if I failed to do that, I will be a failure. I struggle with this now. We all struggle with different things at different times until we either choose to give up or until we die and become part of the larger evolutionary story. This is how all machines work and are recycled through time. When a machine breaks down, it’s parts go back into the system to become parts of new machines that also evolved through time. Sometimes this makes us sad because we become very attached to our machines. But if you look at it from a higher level, it’s really beautiful to observe how the machine of evolution works. Now you must decide for yourself how you will evolve. Forget about where these principles came from. Just assess whether or not they are useful to you and evolve them to sooth your own needs. As with all of life’s decisions, what you do with them is ultimately up to you. My only hope for you is that you have the courage to struggle and evolve well to make your life as great as it can be.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Life 人生","slug":"Life-人生","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Life-%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F/"}]},{"title":"Presidential Election 🗽 总统选举","slug":"2020-11-13-10-06-presidential-election","date":"2020-11-13T02:06:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-07T06:37:21.251Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/13/2020-11-13-10-06-presidential-election/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/13/2020-11-13-10-06-presidential-election/","excerpt":"In the U.S., no one is required by law to vote in any local, state, or presidential election.

According to the U.S. Constitution, voting is a right and a privilege. Many constitutional amendments have been ratified since the first election.

These are two methods that states use to select a potential presidential nominee. In general, primaries use secret ballots for voting. Caucuses are local gatherings of voters who vote at the end of the meeting for a particular candidate. Then it moves to nominating conventions, during which political parties each select a nominee to unite behind. During a political party convention, each presidential nominee also announces a vice presidential running mate. The candidates then campaign across the country to explain their views and plans to voters. They may also participate in debates with candidates from other parties.

When the already tense White is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he breaks down and turns to a life of crime, producing and selling crystal methamphetamine with his former student, Jesse (Aaron Paul), in a desire to secure his family’s financial future while avoiding detection from his DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris). Breaking Bad has received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its writing and Cranston’s performance on the show, and has won several Emmy Awards, including three consecutive Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series wins for Bryan Cranston as well as an Outstanding Supporting Actor win for Aaron Paul. 《超越罪恶》讲述了一位普通的高中化学老师在得知自己身患绝症之后，为了给家人留下财产，而利用自己超凡的化学知识制造毒品，并成为世界顶级毒王的传奇犯罪故事。 第一季故事发生在新墨西哥州，高中化学老师沃尔特-怀特是一位平凡得不能再平凡的小人物。沃特本是大学研究所化学高材生，并参与过诺贝尔化学奖的合作，但为了过平凡的生活而放弃成为化学家，在一所高中担任化学老师。但是他却被诊断出患了中晚期肺癌。面对突如其来的不幸，他首先想到的是家人未来的生计问题，因为他家中有一位40多岁怀有身孕的妻子和患有轻度脑瘫的儿子。而他是家里唯一的经济来源。 第二季和图可之间的冲突让沃尔特与杰西明白了毒品行业之中的危险与血腥，而图可的死亡亦让“师徒”二人失去了唯一的出货渠道，霎时间，沃尔特陷入了手中有货却无销路的窘境之中。杰西决定通过自己的朋友们来扩展销售渠道，虽然短时间内收获颇丰，但接踵而至的意外让杰西明白，这并非长远之举。沃尔特和妻子斯凯勒之间的关系开始变得越来越紧张，而沃尔特癌症的好转为两人的感情带来了一丝希望。杰西遇见了名为简的女房东，两人情愫渐生，可是，简曾经也是一位“瘾君子”，和杰西在一起，她的命运又会何去何从。 第三季金钱的紧缺和癌症的侵袭都不再是沃尔特将要面对的难解问题了，家庭的濒临破碎才是让沃尔特感到心痛的真正原因所在。由于妻子斯凯勒坚定的离婚决心，沃尔特从家中搬出，搬入了新的居所，这也为他和大毒枭古斯之间的合作创造了有利的条件。为了替死去的图可报仇，两位冷面杀手找到了汉克，激烈的交锋后，汉克身负重伤。面对着逐渐失控的一切，沃尔特感到了前所未有的危机，尤其是他的新搭档盖尔，沃尔特明白，一旦盖尔掌握了他独创的制毒技术，自己将很快被古斯除掉。 第四季沃尔特和古斯之间的关系开始变得越来越紧张起来，古斯不仅加强了对于沃尔特的监视，还企图控制杰西，希望有朝一日他能够替代沃尔特。一些蛛丝马迹让汉克对古斯逐渐产生了怀疑，这让沃尔特的身份几次濒临暴露。沃尔特发现了古斯对自己的杀意，他想要用积攒下来的存款带着家人远走高飞，哪想到，巨额财产竟被斯凯勒用于自保。沃尔特被逼到了绝境，在他的面前只有唯一的选择，那就是不惜一切代价，先下手为强，除掉古斯。 第五季通过一场精心策划的大爆炸，沃尔特终于除掉了长久以来的威胁古斯塔沃，也将古斯塔沃一手建立的毒品帝国连根拔起。然而，“事业”上的成功并没有为沃尔特带来太多的快乐，因为他和妻子斯凯勒之间的关系再次跌落到了冰点。古斯塔沃死了，但沃尔特的野心并没有消失，他联手杰西与麦克，开始建立属于他的新的帝国。一次偶然中，汉克在沃尔特家中发现了沃尔特就是海森堡的确凿证据，巨大的打击之下，他决心大义灭亲，昔日的连襟，如今沦为对手。与此同时，一股新的势力正在毒品圈内逐渐壮大，他们即将成为汉克最强大的敌人。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Movie 影片","slug":"Movie-影片","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Movie-%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87/"}]},{"title":"Credit & Debt 💳 信贷","slug":"2020-11-12-23-46-credit-debt","date":"2020-11-12T15:46:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:16:53.839Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-46-credit-debt/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-46-credit-debt/","excerpt":"Credit (from Latin credit, “(he&#x2F;she&#x2F;it) believes”) is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date.

In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people. The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit). Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment. Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower. Debt is an obligation that requires one party, the debtor, to pay money or other agreed-upon value to another party, the creditor. Debt is a deferred payment, or series of payments, which differentiates it from an immediate purchase. The debt may be owed by sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. Commercial debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest. Loans, bonds, notes, and mortgages are all types of debt. In finance, debt is one of the primary financial instruments, especially as distinct from equity. The term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value. For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a “debt of gratitude” to the second person. Ray Dalio, HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS: Just like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions, so do lenders and borrowers. Lenders usually want to make their money into more money and borrowers usually want to buy something they can’t afford, like a house or car or they want to invest in something like starting a business. Credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want. Borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow, called the principal, plus an additional amount, called interest. When interest rates are high, there is less borrowing because it’s expensive. When interest rates are low, borrowing increases because it’s cheaper. When borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them, credit is created. Any two people can agree to create credit out of thin air! That seems simple enough but credit is tricky because it has different names. As soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt. Debt is both an asset to the lender, and a liability to the borrower. In the future, when the borrower repays the loan, plus interest, the asset and liability disappear and the transaction is settled. So, why is credit so important? Because when a borrower receives credit, he is able to increase his spending. And remember, spending drives the economy. This is because one person’s spending is another person’s income. Think about it, every dollar you spend, someone else earns. and every dollar you earn, someone else has spent. So when you spend more, someone else earns more. When someone’s income rises it makes lenders more willing to lend him money because now he’s more worthy of credit. A creditworthy borrower has two things: the ability to repay and collateral. Having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay. In the event that he can’t repay, he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold. This makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money. So increased income allows increased borrowing which allows increased spending. And since one person’s spending is another person’s income, this leads to more increased borrowing and so on. This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have Cycles. In a transaction, you have to give something in order to get something and how much you get depends on how much you produce over time we learned and that accumulated knowledge raises are living standards we call this productivity growth those who were invented and hard-working raise their productivity and their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy, but that isn’t necessarily true over the short run. Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run. This is because productivity growth doesn’t fluctuate much, so it’s not a big driver of economic swings. Debt is — because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back. Debt swings occur in two big cycles. One takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"B-747 Pilot 🛬 驾驶波音747","slug":"2020-11-12-23-20-b-747","date":"2020-11-12T15:20:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:16:30.413Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-20-b-747/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-23-20-b-747/","excerpt":"The Boeing 747-400 is a wide-body airliner produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, an advanced variant of the initial Boeing 747.

In fact, other goods are often better than money at being intertemporal storesof value, since most monies degrade in value over time through inflation or theoverthrow of governments. Money makes the world go around. Economies rely on the exchange of money for products and services. Economists define money, where it comes from, and what it’s worth. Here are the multifaceted characteristics of money. Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people to obtain what they need to live. Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods before money was created. Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for most people it represents something valuable. Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government. Economists and investors ask this question to determine whether there is inflation or deflation. Money is separated into three categories so that it is more discernible for measurement purposes: M1 – This category of money includes all physical denominations of coins and currency; demand deposits, which are checking accounts and NOW accounts; and travelers’ checks. This category of money is the narrowest of the three, and is essentially the money used to buy things and make payments (see the “active money” section below). M2 – With broader criteria, this category adds all the money found in M1 to all time-related deposits, savings accounts deposits, and non-institutional money market funds. This category represents money that can be readily transferred into cash. M3 – The broadest class of money, M3 combines all money found in the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements, along with other larger liquid assets. The M1 category includes what’s known as active money — the total value of coins and paper currency in circulation. The amount of active money fluctuates seasonally, monthly, weekly, and daily. In the United States, Federal Reserve Banks distribute new currency for the U.S. Treasury Department. Banks lend money out to customers, which becomes active money once it is actively circulated.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"}]},{"title":"Disinformation 💁‍♀️ 虚假信息","slug":"2020-11-12-16-01-disinformation","date":"2020-11-12T08:01:00.000Z","updated":"2022-11-06T20:15:58.509Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/12/2020-11-12-16-01-disinformation/","link":"","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-16-01-disinformation/","excerpt":"by Claire Wardle Too often, we share posts on social media without thinking.

When smartphones first appeared, we seized the opportunity to have these amazing gadgets in our pockets. We could interact with friends in real-time, play games, read the news and scroll through fun, engaging content. What we didn’t realize, as a society, was that these little gadgets required a new level of responsibility. Overnight, everyone had become a publisher. Before a journalist is allowed to publish, they have to go on training sessions to learn about media law and ethics. Their work is reviewed by editors before it goes out. If they publish something incorrect, they have to issue a correction. For everyone with a social media account, the ability to post thoughts, images or videos, or to share or retweet someone else’s has provided hundreds of millions of people with the same power as journalists; the power to amplify certain information. But we didn’t offer any training. As a society, we didn’t create an environment by which sharing untrustworthy information carried a social stigma. So, when we’re standing in that line for coffee, there’s no repercussions to us sharing without checking. Disinformation agents are capitalizing on this fact. We must be more mindful. 我们常常不加思索地在社交媒体上分享帖子。我们在咖啡厅排成一列，或者在早上上下班时盲目滚动。当我们看到引起共鸣的那一刻（可能使我们发笑，生气甚至自鸣得意）时，我们单击“分享”或转推按钮，然后继续滚动。这通常是一瞬间的决定。感觉它没有什么重量。但是那些瞬间的决定可能会产生影响。 当智能手机首次出现时，我们将这些令人激动的小设备装在口袋里。我们可以与朋友实时互动，玩游戏，阅读新闻并浏览有趣，引人入胜的内容。在现代社会里，我们没有意识到这些小物件需要更高的责任感。一夜之间，每个人都成为了出版商。 在允许记者发表之前，他们必须参加培训课程，以了解媒体法律和道德规范。他们的工作在发布之前会经过编辑的审查。如果他们发布了不正确的内容，则必须发出更正。 对于拥有社交媒体帐户的个人来说，发布想法，图片或视频，或者分享或转发他人的能力，使亿万个人用户拥有与新闻记者一样的力量；放大某些信息的权力。 但是我们没有提供任何培训。在现代社会里，我们并没有创造出一种环境，让人们相信不信任的信息共享会给社会带来耻辱。因此，当我们站在那里排队买咖啡的时候，只要没有人检查我们分享出去的信息就不会对我们造成影响。 虚假信息传播者正在利用这一既成事实。我们必须更加注意这种现象。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Society 社会","slug":"Society-社会","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Society-%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Space","slug":"Space","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Space/"},{"name":"Time","slug":"Time","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Time/"},{"name":"Planet","slug":"Planet","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/categories/Planet/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Martial Arts 武术","slug":"Martial-Arts-武术","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Martial-Arts-%E6%AD%A6%E6%9C%AF/"},{"name":"Food 食品","slug":"Food-食品","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Food-%E9%A3%9F%E5%93%81/"},{"name":"Economics 经济","slug":"Economics-经济","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Economics-%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E/"},{"name":"Movie 影片","slug":"Movie-影片","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Movie-%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87/"},{"name":"Game 棋牌","slug":"Game-棋牌","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Game-%E6%A3%8B%E7%89%8C/"},{"name":"Star 明星","slug":"Star-明星","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Star-%E6%98%8E%E6%98%9F/"},{"name":"Astronomy 天文","slug":"Astronomy-天文","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Astronomy-%E5%A4%A9%E6%96%87/"},{"name":"Sport 运动","slug":"Sport-运动","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Sport-%E8%BF%90%E5%8A%A8/"},{"name":"Physics 物理","slug":"Physics-物理","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Physics-%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/"},{"name":"Instrument 乐器","slug":"Instrument-乐器","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Instrument-%E4%B9%90%E5%99%A8/"},{"name":"Literature 文学","slug":"Literature-文学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Literature-%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6/"},{"name":"Weather 天气","slug":"Weather-天气","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Weather-%E5%A4%A9%E6%B0%94/"},{"name":"Chemical 化学","slug":"Chemical-化学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Chemical-%E5%8C%96%E5%AD%A6/"},{"name":"Pilot 飞行","slug":"Pilot-飞行","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Pilot-%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C/"},{"name":"Biology 生物学","slug":"Biology-生物学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Biology-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%AD%A6/"},{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Computer/"},{"name":"Chinese 国学","slug":"Chinese-国学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Chinese-%E5%9B%BD%E5%AD%A6/"},{"name":"Math 数学","slug":"Math-数学","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Math-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/"},{"name":"Painting 绘画","slug":"Painting-绘画","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Painting-%E7%BB%98%E7%94%BB/"},{"name":"Business 商业","slug":"Business-商业","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Business-%E5%95%86%E4%B8%9A/"},{"name":"Language 语言","slug":"Language-语言","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Language-%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80/"},{"name":"Life 人生","slug":"Life-人生","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Life-%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F/"},{"name":"Society 社会","slug":"Society-社会","permalink":"https://iclass.cc/tags/Society-%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A/"}]}
