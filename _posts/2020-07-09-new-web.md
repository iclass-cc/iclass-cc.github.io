For 30+ years, your customers have traded their personal information for free services on the Web. Email, physical addresses, sensitive data, and more, have been handed over in order to access the products, services, and connections that you offer.

However, the time has come where innovation and privacy have finally collided with each other, and it’s time for a revolution.

A revolution where companies use the decentralized web to satisfy privacy concerns and government regulations. Where customers, who trust and value their providers, allow consented access to a world of personal data not previously available.

D-Web uses content addressing to identify content by what's in it, rather than by where it's located. Looking for an item by content is something you already do all the time. For example, when you look for a book in the library, you often ask for it by the title; that's content addressing because you're asking for what it is. If you were using location addressing to find that book, you'd ask for it by where it is: "I want the book that's on the second floor, first stack, third shelf from the bottom, four books from the left." If someone moved that book, you'd be out of luck!

The blockchain will be a core part of D-Web but the next generation internet will also see the convergence of the Internet of Things and big data analytics. The ongoing fundamental process of datafication will be a key aspect of this next generation internet. As we increasingly instrument our world data will flow from all sources about everything. D-Web will incorporate various aspects of machine learning and cognitive computing as-a-service as it becomes infused into almost all applications making it truly adaptive, responsive and personalized.

人类社会中的各种价值凭证均可基于区块链技术用通证来表示，实现全面数字化。到目前为止，通证仅在区块链技术本身所在的加密数字货币、加密资产交易等极小范围内得到应用，当然亦在票据、央行数字货币、发票与消费积分等有研究与试点。
