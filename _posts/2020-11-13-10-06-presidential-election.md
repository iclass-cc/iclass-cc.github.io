In the U.S., no one is required by law to vote in any local, state, or presidential election. According to the U.S. Constitution, voting is a right and a privilege. Many constitutional amendments have been ratified since the first election. However, none of them made voting mandatory for U.S. citizens.

The [election process](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/election-process.html) begins with [primary elections and caucuses](https://www.usa.gov/election#item-37162). These are two methods that states use to select a potential presidential *nominee*. In general, primaries use secret ballots for voting. Caucuses are local gatherings of voters who vote at the end of the meeting for a particular candidate. Then it moves to [nominating conventions](https://www.usa.gov/election#item-212585), during which political parties each select a nominee to unite behind. During a political party convention, each presidential nominee also announces a vice presidential running mate. The candidates then campaign across the country to explain their views and plans to voters. They may also participate in debates with candidates from other parties.
