The Economics Glossary defines money as follows:

> Money is a good that acts as a medium of exchange in transactions. Classically it is 
> said that money acts as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange. 
> Most authors find that the first two are nonessential properties that follow from the 
> third. In fact, other goods are often better than money at being intertemporal stores 
> of value, since most monies degrade in value over time through inflation or the 
> overthrow of governments.

Money makes the world go around. Economies rely on the exchange of money for products and services. Economists define money, where it comes from, and what it's worth. Here are the multifaceted characteristics of money.

* Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people to obtain what they need to live.
* Bartering was one way that people exchanged goods for other goods before money was created.
* Like gold and other precious metals, money has worth because for most people it represents something valuable.
* Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity but by the stability of the issuing government.
