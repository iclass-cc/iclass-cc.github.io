The Economics Glossary defines money as follows:

> Money is a good that acts as a medium of exchange in transactions. Classically it is 
> said that money acts as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange. 
> Most authors find that the first two are nonessential properties that follow from the 
> third. In fact, other goods are often better than money at being intertemporal stores 
> of value, since most monies degrade in value over time through inflation or the 
> overthrow of governments.
