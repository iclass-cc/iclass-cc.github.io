$$
\oint_{\gamma} f(z) d z=0
$$

 Cauchy's integral formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a central statement in complex analysis. It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk, and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy's formula shows that, in complex analysis, "differentiation is equivalent to integration": complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits – a result that does not hold in real analysis.

$$
A=\pi-\alpha-\beta-\gamma

In mathematics, non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on axioms closely related to those that specify Euclidean geometry. As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-Euclidean geometry arises by either relaxing the metric requirement, or replacing the parallel postulate with an alternative.

Between 1820 and 1823, **Bolyai** prepared, but did not immediately publish, a treatise on a complete system of non-Euclidean geometry.

Completely independent from Bolyai, in the distant provincial Russian city of Kazan, **Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky** had also been working, along very similar lines as Bolyai, to develop a geometry in which Euclid’s fifth postulate did not apply. His work on hyperbolic geometry was first reported in 1826 and published in 1830, although it did not have general circulation until some time later.

This early non-Euclidean geometry is now often referred to as Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, thus sharing the credit.
