### Divergence

Divergence is an operation on a vector field that tells us how the field behaves toward or away from a point. Locally, the divergence of a vector field $\vecs{F}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ at a particular point $𝑃$ is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of the vector field at $𝑃$. If $\vecs{F} represents the velocity of a fluid, then the divergence of $\vecs{F}$ at $𝑃$ measures the net rate of change with respect to time of the amount of fluid flowing away from $𝑃$ (the tendency of the fluid to flow “out of” P). In particular, if the amount of fluid flowing into $𝑃$ is the same as the amount flowing out, then the divergence at $𝑃$ is zero.
