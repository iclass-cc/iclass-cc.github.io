The **butterfly effect** is the idea that small, seemingly trivial events may ultimately result in something with much larger consequences – in other words, they have non-linear impacts on very complex systems. For instance, when a butterfly flaps its wings in India, that tiny change in air pressure could eventually cause a tornado in Iowa.

The term "butterfly effect" was coined in the 1960s by **Edward Lorenz**, a meteorology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was studying weather patterns. He devised a model demonstrating that if you compare two starting points indicating current weather that are near each other, they'll soon drift apart – and later, one area could wind up with severe storms, while the other is calm.

Later, other scientists realized the importance of Lorenz's discovery. His insights laid the foundation for a branch of mathematics known as chaos theory, the idea of trying to predict the behavior of systems that are inherently unpredictable.

You can see instances of the butterfly effect every day. Weather's just one example. Climate change is another. Because, as it turns out, warming climates are impacting – appropriately enough – species of alpine butterflies in North America.

蝴蝶效应是混沌学理论中的一个概念。
它是指对初始条件敏感性的一种依赖现象：
输入端微小的差别会迅速放大到输出端，蝴蝶效应在经济生活中比比皆是。

“蝴蝶效应”也可称“台球效应”，它是“混沌性系统”对初值极为敏感的形象化术语，
也是非线性系统在一定条件（可称为“临界性条件”或“阈值条件”）出现混沌现象的直接原因。

混沌不是偶然的、个别的事件，而是普遍存在于宇宙间各种各样的宏观及微观系统的，万事万物，莫不混沌。

混沌也不是独立存在的科学，它与其它各门科学互相促进、互相依靠，
由此派生出许多交叉学科，如混沌气象学、混沌经济学、混沌数学等。

混沌学不仅极具研究价值，而且有现实应用价值，能直接或间接创造财富。
