A transaction is a completed agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange goods, services, or financial assets. But in business bookkeeping, this plain definition can get complicated. A transaction will be recorded earlier or later depending on whether the company uses accrual accounting rather than cash accounting.

- The accrual accounting method requires a transaction to be recorded when it occurs, regardless of when the money is received or the expenses are paid.
- The cash accounting method records a transaction only when the money is received or the expenses are paid. This may require a letter of intent or a memorandum of understanding.

Accrual accounting is used by businesses with gross receipts above $1 million a year, while the cash accounting method is used by most small businesses.
