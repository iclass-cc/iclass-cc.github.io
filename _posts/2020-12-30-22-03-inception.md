A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.

## Storyline

Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.

多姆·柯布 是一位经验老道的窃贼，他在这一行中算得上是最厉害的，因为他能够潜入人们精神最为脆弱的梦境中，窃取潜意识中有价值的秘密。柯布这一罕见的技能使他成为危险的企业间谍活动中最令人垂涎的对象，但这也让他成为了一名国际逃犯，失去自己的所爱。如今柯布有了一个赎罪的机会，只要完成最后一项任务他的生活就会回复本来面目。与以往不同的是，柯布和他的团队这一次的任务不是窃取思想，而是植入思想。如果他们成功，这就是一次完美犯罪。但是即使提前做好了细致专业的安排，也无法预料到危险的敌人对他们的行动早已了如指掌，而只有柯布能够预料到敌人的行踪。
