> The fast fourier transform or FFT is without exaggeration one of the most important algorithms created in the last century. So much of the modern technology that we have today such as wireless communication, GPS and in fact anything related to the vast field of signal processing relies on the insights of the FFT.

> But it's also one of the most beautiful albums you'll ever see. The depth and sheer number of brilliant ideas that went into it is just astounding it's easy to miss the beauty aspect of the FFT since it's often introduced in fairly complex settings that require a lot of prerequisite knowledge such as the discrete fourier transform time domain to frequency domain conversions and much more.

The [Fast Fourier Transform](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Electrical_Engineering/Signal_Processing_and_Modeling/Book%3A_Signals_and_Systems_(Baraniuk_et_al.)/13%3A_Capstone_Signal_Processing_Topics/13.02%3A_The_Fast_Fourier_Transform_(FFT)) (FFT) is an efficient O(NlogN) algorithm for calculating DFTs. The FFT exploits symmetries in the $W$ matrix to take a "divide and conquer" approach. We will first discuss deriving the actual FFT algorithm, some of its implications for the [DFT](https://cnx.org/contents/d2CEAGW5@15.4:nkErv5ik#eqn1), and a speed comparison to drive home the importance of this powerful algorithm.

To derive the FFT, we assume that the signal's duration is a power of two:  $N=2^l$ . Consider what happens to the even-numbered and odd-numbered elements of the sequence in the DFT calculation.

$$\begin{align}S(k) &=s(0)+s(2) e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi 2 k}{N}}+\ldots+s(N-2) e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi(N-2) k}{N}}+s(1) e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi k}{N}}+s(3) e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi \times (2+1) k}{N}}+\ldots+s(N-1) e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi(N-2+1) k}{N}} \nonumber \\ &=s(0)+s(2)e^{(-j)\frac{2\pi k}{\frac{N}{2}}} + \ldots + s(N-2)e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi\left(\frac{N}{2}-1\right) k}{\frac{N}{2}}} +\left( s(1)+s(3) e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi k}{\frac{N}{2}}}+\dots+s(N-1) e^{(-j) \frac{2 \pi\left(\frac{N}{2}-1\right) k}{\frac{N}{2}}}\right) e^{\frac{-(j 2 \pi k)}{N}} \end{align}$$

> The initial decomposition of a length-8 DFT into the terms using even- and odd-indexed inputs marks the first phase of developing the FFT algorithm. When these half-length transforms are successively decomposed, we are left with the diagram shown in the bottom panel that depicts the length-8 FFT computation.
